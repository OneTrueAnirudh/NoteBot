      "Chunk 1: ARISTOTLE (384–322 B.C.)  \n",
      "Wisdom starts with understanding yourself  \n",
      "Aristotle was born around 384 b.c. Though little is known about his mother, Aristotle’s father was court physician to the Macedonian king Amyntas II (the connection and affiliation with the Macedonian court would continue to play an important role throughout Aristotle’s life). Both of Aristotle’s parents died when he was young, and at the age of seventeen, Aristotle’s guardian sent him to Athens to pursue a higher education. It was in Athens that Aristotle would enroll in Plato’s Academy and study under Plato. He would remain there for the next twenty years, studying with Plato as both a student and colleague.  \n",
      "When Plato died in 347 b.c., many believed Aristotle would take his place as director of the Academy. However, by that time, Aristotle had differing views on several of Plato’s works (for example, he disagreed with Plato’s theory of Forms), and Aristotle was not offered the position.  \n",
      "In 338 b.c., Aristotle returned to Macedonia and began tutoring the thirteen-year-old son of King Philip II, Alexander (later known as “the Great”). When, in 335 b.c., Alexander became king and conquered Athens, Aristotle returned to Athens. While Plato’s Academy (which was now directed by Xenocrates) was still the major school in the city, Aristotle decided to create his own school, the Lyceum.  \n",
      "With the death of Alexander the Great in 323 b.c., the government was overthrown and anti-Macedonian sentiment was high. Facing charges of impiety, Aristotle fled Athens to avoid being prosecuted and remained on the island of Euboea until his death in 322 b.c.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Chunk 2: LOGIC  \n",
      "While Aristotle focused on many different subjects, one of his most significant contributions to the world of philosophy and Western thought was his creation of logic. To Aristotle, the process of learning could be placed into three distinct categories: theoretical, practical, and productive. Logic, however, did not belong to any one of these categories.  \n",
      "Instead, logic was a tool used to attain knowledge, and was therefore the very first step in the learning process. Logic enables us to discover errors and establish truths.  \n",
      "In his book, Prior Analytics, Aristotle introduced the notion of the syllogism, which turned out to be one of the most important contributions to the field of logic. A syllogism is a type of reasoning whereby a conclusion can be deduced based on a series of specific premises or assumptions.  \n",
      "For example:  \n",
      "All Greek people are human.  \n",
      "All humans are mortal.  \n",
      "Therefore, all Greek people are mortal.  \n",
      "To further break down what a syllogism is, one can summarize it in the following way:  \n",
      "If all X are Y, and all Y are Z, then all X are Z.  \n",
      "Syllogisms are made up of three propositions: the first two are premises; the last is the conclusion. Premises can either be universal (using words like every, all, or no) or particular (for example, using the word some), and they can also be affirmative or negative.  \n",
      "Aristotle then set out to create a set of rules that would produce a valid inference. One classic example is:  \n",
      "At least one premise has to be universal.  \n",
      "At least one premise has to be affirmative.  \n",
      "If one of the premises is negative, the conclusion will be negative.  \n",
      "For example:  \n",
      "No dogs are birds.  \n",
      "Parrots are birds.  \n",
      "Therefore, no dogs are parrots.  \n",
      "Aristotle believed three rules applied to all valid thoughts:  \n",
      "The law of identity: This law states that X is X, and this holds true because X has certain characteristics. A tree is a tree because we can see the leaves, the trunk, the branches, and so on. A tree does not have another identity other than a tree. Therefore, everything that exists has its own characteristics true to itself.  \n",
      "The law of noncontradiction: This law states X can’t be X and not X simultaneously. A statement can never be true and false at the exact same time. If this were the case, a contradiction would arise. If you were to say you fed the cat yesterday and then say you did not feed the cat yesterday, there is a contradiction.  \n",
      "The law of the excluded middle: This law claims a statement can be either true or false; there cannot be middle ground. This law also claims something has to either be true or be false. If you say your hair is blond, the statement is either true or false. However, later philosophers and mathematicians would dispute this law.\n",

The  word  philosophy  means  “love  of  wisdom.”  Indeed,  it  is  a  love  of wisdom  that  guides  philosophers  to  explore  the  fundamental  questions about  who  we  are  and  why  we’re  here.  On  the  surface,  philosophy  is  a social science. But as you read this book, you’ll discover that it is so much more  than  that.  Philosophy  touches  on  every  subject  you  could  possibly think of. It’s not just a bunch of old Greek guys asking each other questions over and over again (though it has its fair share of that as well). Philosophy has very real applications; from the ethical questions raised in government policy to the logic forms required in computer programming, everything has its roots in philosophy. Through philosophy, we are able to explore concepts like the meaning of life,  knowledge,  morality,  reality,  the  existence  of  God,  consciousness, politics, religion, economics, art, linguistics—philosophy has no bounds! In a very broad sense, there are six major themes philosophy touches on: 1. Metaphysics: The study of the universe and reality 2. Logic: How to create a valid argument 3. Epistemology: The study of knowledge and how we acquire knowledge 4. Aesthetics: The study of art and beauty 5. Politics: The study of political rights, government, and the role of citizens 6. Ethics: The study of morality and how one should live his life If you’ve ever thought, “Oh, philosophy. I’ll never be able to understand that stuff,” then fear not. This is the crash course in philosophy that you’ve always  wanted.  Finally,  you’ll  be  able  to  open  your  mind  without  making your eyes bleed. Welcome to Philosophy 101.']...\n",

These philosophers, later referred  to  as  pre-Socratic,  started  to  question  the  world  around  them. Rather  than  attributing  their  surroundings  to  the  Greek  gods,  these philosophers searched for more rational explanations that could explain the world, the universe, and their existence. This  was  a  philosophy  of  nature.  Pre-Socratic  philosophers  questioned where  everything  came  from,  what  everything  was  created  from,  how nature  could  be  described  mathematically,  and  how  one  could  explain  the existence  of  plurality  in  nature.  They  sought  to  find  a  primary  principle, known as archê, which was  the  basic  material of the  universe. Due  to  the fact  that  not  everything  in  the  universe  looks  the  same  or  remains  in  the same  exact  state,  pre-Socratic  philosophers  determined  that  there  must  be principles of change that the archê contained.']...\n",

Rather,  the  term  pre-Socratic  relates  to  the  difference  in  ideology  and principles.  While  many  pre-Socratic  philosophers  produced  texts,  none have fully survived and most of what we understand about the pre-Socratic philosophers is based on the fragments of text that remain and the quotes of later historians and philosophers, which were usually biased.']...\n",

From  Miletus  came  three and important philosophers:  Thales,  Anaximander, pre-Socratic Anaximenes. Thales One  of  the  most  important  pre-Socratic  philosophers,  Thales  (624–546 b.c.),  claimed  the  archê,  or  the  single  element,  was  water.  Thales determined that  water  could  experience  principles  of  change like evaporation  and  condensation,  therefore  allowing  for  it  to  be  gaseous  or solid.  He  also  knew  that  water  was  responsible  for  moisture  (which  heat was  generated  from)  and  nourishment.  Thales  even  believed  the  earth floated on water. Anaximander Following Thales, the next major philosopher to come out of Miletus was Anaximander  (610–546  b.c.).  Unlike  Thales,  Anaximander  claimed  the single  element  was  actually  an  undefined,  unlimited,  and  indefinite substance, known as apeiron.  From  this,  opposites  like  moist  and  dry  and cold  and  hot  separated  from  each  other.  Anaximander  is  known  for  being the first philosopher that we know of to have left writings of his work. Anaximenes The  last  important  pre-Socratic  philosopher  of  the  Milesian  school  was Anaximenes  (585–528  b.c.),  who  believed  the  single  element  was  air. According to Anaximenes, air is everywhere and has the ability to undergo processes and become transformed into other things, such as water, clouds, wind, fire, and even the earth.']...\n",

      "Content: ['The Eleatic school was based in Colophon, an ancient city not far from Miletus.  From  this  region  came  four  important  pre-Socratic  philosophers: Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, and Melissus. Xenophanes of Colophon Xenophanes  (570–475  b.c.)  is  known  for  his  critique  of  religion  and mythology.  In  particular,  he  attacked  the  notion  that  the  gods  were anthropomorphic (or took a human form). Xenophanes believed there was one god that, while it did not physically move, had the ability to hear, see, and think, and controlled the world with his thoughts. Parmenides of Elea Parmenides  (510–440  b.c.)  believed  reality  didn’t  have  to  do  with  the world one experienced and that it was only through reason, not the senses, that one would be able to arrive at the truth. Parmenides concluded that the work of earlier Milesian philosophers was not only unintelligible; they were asking the wrong questions to begin with. To Parmenides, it made no sense to discuss what is and what is not, for the only intelligible thing to discuss, and the only thing that is true, is what is (what exists). Parmenides  had  an  incredible  impact  on  Plato  and  all  of  Western philosophy. His work led the school of Elea to become the first movement to use pure reason as the only criterion for finding truth. Zeno of Elea Zeno of Elea (490–430 b.c.) was Parmenides’ most famous student (and possibly his lover), who devoted his time to creating arguments (known as paradoxes)  that  defended  Parmenides’  ideas.  In  Zeno’s  most  famous paradoxes, the paradoxes of motion, he attempted to show that ontological pluralism, the notion that many things exist as opposed to one, will actually lead  to  conclusions  that  are  absurd.  Parmenides  and  Zeno  believed  that reality existed as one thing, and that things like plurality and motion were nothing  more  than  illusions.  Though  the  work  of  Zeno  would  later  be disproved,  his  paradoxes  still  raise  important  questions,  challenges,  and inspirations for philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians. Melissus of Samos Melissus of Samos, who lived around 440 b.c., was the last philosopher of the Eleatic school. Continuing the ideas of Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, Melissus of Samos distinguished between is and seems. When a thing is X, according to Melissus of Samos, it has to always be X (and never not X). Therefore, according to this idea, when something is cold, it can never stop being  cold.  But  since  this  is  not  the  case,  and  properties  are  not  retained indefinitely,  nothing  (except  for  the  Parmenidean  Real,  reality  existing  as one continuous, unchanging thing) actually ever is; rather, it seems.']...\n",

This  idea  is  not  too  far  from  the concepts  of  atoms  that  we  know  today.  This  school  believed  that  atoms were incredibly small particles (so small that they could not be cut in half) that  differed  in  size,  shape,  motion,  arrangement,  and  position,  and  that when put together, these atoms created what is seen in the visible world.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Socrates was born in Athens, Greece, around 469 b.c. and died in 399 b.c. Whereas  pre-Socratic  philosophers  examined  the  natural  world,  Socrates placed  emphasis  on  the  human  experience.  He  focused  on  individual morality,  questioned  what  made  a  good  life,  and  discussed  social  and political  questions.  His  work  and  his  ideas  became  the  foundation  of Western philosophy. While Socrates is widely regarded as one of the wisest men  to  have ever  lived, he never  wrote down any of his  thoughts, and all that we know about him is based on the written works of his students and contemporaries (mainly the works of Plato, Xenophon, and Aristophanes). Because  everything  that  we  know  about  Socrates  is  based  on  accounts from others (which were often fictionalized) and these accounts differ, we do not actually know much about him or his teachings. This is known as the “Socratic problem.” From the texts of others, we are able to gather that he was  the  son  of  a  stone  mason  and  a  midwife;  he  most  likely  had  a  basic Greek  education;  he  was  not  aesthetically  good-looking  (during  a  time when external beauty was very important); he served in the military during the Peloponnesian War; he had three sons with a much younger woman; and he lived in poverty. He might have worked as a stone mason before turning to philosophy. The  one  detail  that  has  been  well  documented,  however,  is  Socrates’ death.  While  Socrates  was  alive,  the  state  of  Athens  began  to  decline. Having embarrassingly lost to Sparta in the Peloponnesian War, Athens had an  identity  crisis  of  sorts  and  became  fixated  on  physical  beauty,  ideas  of wealth,  and  romanticizing  the  past.  Because  Socrates  was  an  outspoken critic  of  this  way  of  life,  he  grew  to  have  many  enemies.  In  399  b.c., Socrates was arrested and brought to trial with charges of being unreligious and  corrupting  the  city’s  youth.  Socrates  was  found  guilty  and  was sentenced to death by poisonous drink. Rather than flee into exile (which he had the chance to do), Socrates drank the poison without any hesitation.']...\n",

Identity/Contradiction: If a proposition is true, its negation must be false, and vice versa. 2. Sufficient Reason: In order for anything to exist, any event to occur, or any truth to be had, there has to be a sufficient reason (though this is sometimes only known by God). 3. Identity of Indiscernibles (Leibniz’s Law): Two things that are distinct from one another cannot have every single property in common. If all predicates possessed by X are also possessed by Y, and all predicates possessed by Y are also possessed by X, then X and Y are identical. To claim that two things are indiscernible is supposing two names for the same thing. 4. Optimism: God always chooses the best. 5. Pre-Established Harmony: Substances can only affect themselves; however, all substances (be they mind or body) causally interact with one another. This is the result of God having programmed all substances to harmonize with one another in advance. 6. Plenitude: The best of every possible world would make every genuine possibility a reality. 7. Law of Continuity: Leibniz states in his law of continuity that “nature never takes leaps.” Leibniz claims that all change goes through intermediate change and that there is an infinity in things. The law of continuity is used to prove that no motion can come from total rest; perceptions come from other degrees of perception that are too small to notice.']...\n",

First described in Plato’s Socratic Dialogues, Socrates and a pupil would have a discussion on a particular issue, and through a series of questions, Socrates would set out  to  discover  the  driving  force  behind  how  that  individual’s  beliefs  and sentiments  were  shaped  and  in  so  doing,  get  closer  to  the  truth.  By continually asking questions, Socrates was able to expose contradictions in the  way  an  individual  thought,  which  allowed  him  to  come  to  a  solid conclusion. Socrates used the elenchus, a method in which he would refute the claims of the other person. Here are the steps of the elenchus: 1. An individual would assert a statement to Socrates, which Socrates would then refute. Or, Socrates might ask the other person a question, such as, “What is courage?” 2. Once the other person provides his answer, Socrates would think of a scenario where his answer was not the case, asking him to assume his original statement was false. For example, if the other person describes courage as “endurance of the soul,” Socrates might refute this claim by saying that “Courage is a fine thing,” while “Ignorant endurance is not a fine thing.” 3. The other person would agree with this claim, and Socrates would then change the statement to include the exception to the rule. 4. Socrates proves that the individual’s statement is false and that the negation is in fact true. As the other person continues to alter his answer, Socrates continues refuting, and through this, the individual’s answer gets closer to the actual truth.']...\n",

The professor will then  act  as devil’s advocate by asking a series of questions to make the student defend his decision.

Because  of  his  social  class,  Plato  was taught  by  many  distinguished  educators.  However,  no  individual  would have  as  great  an  impact  on  him  as  Socrates  and  his  ability  to  debate  and create a dialogue. In fact, the written works of Plato are where much of the information we know about Socrates comes from. While he was expected by his family to pursue a career in politics, two events would lead Plato away from this lifestyle: the Peloponnesian War (in which,  upon  Sparta’s  victory,  several  of  Plato’s  relatives  were  part  of  a dictatorship,  but  were  removed  for  being  corrupt)  and  the  execution  of Socrates in 399 b.c. by the new Athenian government. Plato then turned toward philosophy and began writing and traveling. He studied under Pythagoras in Sicily and, upon returning to Athens, founded the  Academy,  a  school  where  he  and  other  likeminded  individuals  taught and  discussed  philosophy  and  mathematics.  Among  Plato’s  students  was Aristotle.']...\n",

Two of the most interesting things about these dialogues are that Plato’s own  opinions  on  the  subject  matters  he  wrote  about  were  never  explicitly stated (though with in-depth research, one might be able to infer his stance) and  that  he  was  never  a  character  in  his  writing.  Plato  wanted  readers  to have the ability to form their own opinions on the subjects and not be told how to think (this also proves how skillful a writer he was). For this reason, many  of  his  dialogues  do  not  reach  a  concise  conclusion.  Those  that  do, however, allow for possible counterarguments and doubts. Plato’s dialogues dealt with a variety of subject matters, including things such as art, theater, ethics, immortality, the mind, and metaphysics.

The visible world that is made up of sights and sounds 2. The intelligible world (the world of Forms) that gives the visible world its being For example, when a person sees a beautiful painting, that person has the ability to identify beauty because he has an abstract concept of what beauty is. Therefore, beautiful things are seen as beautiful because they are a part of  the  Form  of  beauty.  While  things  in  the  visible  world  can  change  and lose their beauty, the Form of beauty is eternal, never changes, and cannot be seen. Plato believed that concepts like beauty, courage, goodness, temperance, and  justice  exist  in  an  entire  world  of  Forms,  outside  of  space  and  time, unaffected by what happens in the visible world. While  the  idea  of  Forms  appears  in  many  of  Plato’s  dialogues,  Plato’s concept of Forms differs from text to text, and sometimes these differences are  never  completely  explained.  Through  Plato’s  theory  of  Forms,  Plato incorporates abstract thought as a means to achieve a greater knowledge.']...\n",

      "Content: ['In  The  Republic  and  another  well-known  dialogue,  Phaedrus,  Plato discusses his understanding of rationality and the soul. The soul, according to Plato, can be broken down into three parts: reason, spirit, and appetite. 1. Reason: This is the part of the soul responsible for thinking and understanding when something is true versus false, real versus not apparent, and making rational decisions. 2. Spirit: This is the part of the soul responsible for all desires that want victory and honor. If an individual has a just soul, the spirit should enforce reason so that reason leads. Frustration of the spirit will lead to feelings of anger and feeling mistreated. 3. Appetite: This is the part of the soul where very basic cravings and desires come from. For example, things like thirst and hunger can be found in this part of the soul. However, the appetite also features unnecessary and unlawful urges, like overeating or sexual excess. To  explain  these  different  parts  of  the  soul,  Plato  first  looked  at  three different  classes  in  a  just  society:  Guardian,  Auxiliary,  and  Laborers. According  to  Plato,  reason  should  rule  an  individual’s  decisions;  spirit should  aid  reason;  and  appetite  should  obey.  By  maintaining  the relationship  among  these  three  parts  in  the  correct  way,  an  individual  will achieve individual justice. Similarly,  Plato  believed  that  in  a  perfect  society,  reason  would  be represented by a Guardian class (rulers who led based on philosophy, which society  would  wholeheartedly  follow);  spirit  would  be  represented  by  the Auxiliary  class  (soldiers  who  would  force  the  rest  of  society  to  obey  the Guardian  class);  and  appetite  would  be  represented  by  the  Laborers,  the workers and merchants of society.']...\n",

In the dialogue, Socrates asks Glaucon to imagine a  world  where  an  illusion  is  perceived  as  reality.  To  further  his  point,  he creates the following example: There exists a cave where, inside, a group of prisoners has been locked up  since  birth.  These  prisoners  cannot  move.  Their  necks  and  legs  are chained so that they can’t shift or turn around and they can only see what is in front of them: a stone wall. Behind and above the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a low wall where people walk, carrying objects  on  their  heads.  The  light  of  the  fire  casts  shadows  of  the  objects onto the wall in front of the prisoners. These shadows are all the prisoners can see. The only sounds they hear are the echoes from the cave. Now,  because  these  prisoners  have  never  been  exposed  to  the  actual objects  and  all  their  lives  they  have  only  witnessed  the  shadows,  they mistake  these  shadows  for  reality.  The  echoes  of  the  cave,  to  them,  are noises  created  by  the  shadows.  If  a  shadow  of  a  book  were  to  appear,  for example, these prisoners would claim that they have seen a book. They are not  saying  this  is  a  shadow  of  a  book,  because  their  reality  doesn’t  know shadows.  Eventually,  one  of  the  prisoners  would  understand  the  nature  of this  world  and  would  be  able  to  guess  what  shadow  would  come  next, which would lead to praise and recognition from the other prisoners. Now,  let’s  suppose  one  of  the  prisoners  is  set  free.  If  a  person  were  to show  that  prisoner  an  actual  book,  the  prisoner  would  not  be  able  to recognize it. To the prisoner, a book is the shadow that was cast on the wall. The illusion of a book seems more real than the book itself. Socrates  continues,  pondering  what  would  happen  if  that  freed  prisoner were to then turn toward the fire. The prisoner would surely turn away from so much light and turn back to the dark shadows, which he holds to be more real.  Now,  what  if  this  was  taken  one  step  further,  and  the  prisoner  was forced to go outside? The prisoner would be angry, distressed, and unable to see the reality before him because he would be so blinded by the light.']...\n",

      "Content: ['While  Aristotle  focused  on  many  different  subjects,  one  of  his  most significant  contributions  to  the  world  of  philosophy  and  Western  thought was  his  creation  of  logic.  To  Aristotle,  the  process  of  learning  could  be placed  into  three  distinct  categories:  theoretical,  practical,  and  productive. Logic, however, did not belong to any one of these categories. Instead, logic was a tool used to attain knowledge, and was therefore the very  first  step  in  the  learning  process.  Logic  enables  us  to  discover  errors and establish truths. In  his  book,  Prior  Analytics,  Aristotle  introduced  the  notion  of  the syllogism, which turned out to be one of the most important contributions to the field of logic. A syllogism is a type of reasoning whereby a conclusion can be deduced based on a series of specific premises or assumptions. For example: All Greek people are human. All humans are mortal. Therefore, all Greek people are mortal. To further break down what a syllogism is, one can summarize it in the following way: If all X are Y, and all Y are Z, then all X are Z. Syllogisms are made up of three propositions: the first two are premises; the last is the conclusion. Premises can either be universal (using words like every, all, or no) or particular (for example, using the word some), and they can also be affirmative or negative. Aristotle then set out to create a set of rules that would produce a valid inference. One classic example is: At least one premise has to be universal. At least one premise has to be affirmative. If one of the premises is negative, the conclusion will be negative. For example: No dogs are birds. Parrots are birds. Therefore, no dogs are parrots. Aristotle believed three rules applied to all valid thoughts: 1. The law of identity: This law states that X is X, and this holds true because X has certain characteristics. A tree is a tree because we can see the leaves, the trunk, the branches, and so on. A tree does not have another identity other than a tree. Therefore, everything that exists has its own characteristics true to itself. 2. The law of noncontradiction: This law states X can’t be X and not X simultaneously. A statement can never be true and false at the exact same time. If this were the case, a contradiction would arise. If you were to say you fed the cat yesterday and then say you did not feed the cat yesterday, there is a contradiction. 3. The law of the excluded middle: This law claims a statement can be either true or false; there cannot be middle ground. This law also claims something has to either be true or be false. If you say your hair is blond, the statement is either true or false. However, later philosophers and mathematicians would dispute this law.']...\n",

Aristotle claimed that the way to attain happiness (and therefore the very purpose of life) is through virtue. Virtue  requires  both  choice  and  habit.  Unlike  other  ways  to  attain happiness, such as pleasure or honor, with virtue, when an individual makes a decision, the decision comes from that individual’s disposition, which is determined by that person’s past choices. A  virtuous  choice  is,  then,  the  mean  between  the  two  most  extreme choices.  Between  acting  cold  to  someone  and  being  overly  subservient  or attentive is the virtuous choice, friendliness. To Aristotle, the ultimate type of happiness is living a life of intellectual contemplation,  and  using  reason  (which  is  what  separates  humans  from other  animals)  is  the  highest  form  of  virtue.  However,  for  one  to  achieve such a level of virtue, a person needs the proper social environment, and a proper  social  environment  can  only  be  attained  by  an  appropriate government.']...\n",

If by the end of that period of time (t2), the object (which is now Y) has the same components, then it continued to exist. In  the  ship  of  Theseus  paradox,  according  to  MTI,  A  =  C.  This  means that there are two ships. The ship Theseus began his voyage on is the exact same  as  the  ship  the  scavenger  comes  in  on  (making  these  one  ship),  and then there is the ship Theseus came to port in, which was composed of new parts. However,  there  is  a  problem  with  this  conclusion.  In  this  scenario, Theseus would have had to change ships in his journey because he comes to the port in B (which does not equal C). But Theseus never leaves his ship. He leaves on A, comes back on B, and was never aboard two ships (which MTI states there must be). There  might  be  other  possible  ways  to  solve  this  problem.  We  can abandon  what  MTI  states  altogether  and  instead  claim  that  A  =  B.  In  this scenario, there are still only two ships: the ship Theseus began his journey in  (A)  and  the  ship  he  came  back  in  (B)  are  considered  one,  and  the scavenger’s ship is the second. This scenario also raises problems. To say that A = B would also imply that B  ≠  C  and therefore  A ≠  C.  But one cannot  feasibly  say this because every part of C is a part of A and vice versa. In addition, A and B do not have any parts in common, and yet we are claiming that they are the same ship. Another  theory  that  can  be  applied  to  the  paradox  of  Theseus’s  ship  is called spatiotemporal continuity (STC). This theory states that an object can have a continuous path in space-time, as long as the change is gradual and the shape and form are preserved. This would allow for the gradual changes that are made to the ship over time. However,  even  here  we  see  problems!  What  if  every  piece  of  the  ship was  packed  in  individual  boxes,  shipped  all  over  the  world  to  different locations,  then  shipped  back,  and  then  opened  and  reassembled?  While numerically it may be the same ship, the object does not constantly exist as a ship-like object through space-time (note that MTI does seem to fit in this scenario).']...\n",

Bacon  was  born  in  London,  England,  on  January  22,  1561.  He  was  the youngest child of his father, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Seal, and  his  mother,  Lady  Anne  Cooke  Bacon,  who  was  the  daughter  of  the knight that tutored Edward VI. In  1573,  when  he  was  just  eleven  years  old,  Francis  Bacon  attended Trinity  College,  Cambridge.  After  completing  his  studies  in  1575,  Bacon enrolled  in  a  law  program  the  next  year.  It  didn’t  take  him  very  long  to realize that this school was too old-fashioned for his tastes (Bacon recalled that his tutors favored Aristotle, while he was much more interested in the humanistic  movement  that  was  spreading  across  the  land  due  to  the Renaissance). Bacon left school and became an assistant to the ambassador in France. In 1579, when his father passed away, Bacon returned to London and resumed studying law, completing his degree in 1582. In  1584,  Francis  Bacon  was  elected  to  Parliament  as  a  member  for Melcombe in Dorsetshire, and he would continue to work in Parliament for the next thirty-six years. Eventually, under James I, Francis Bacon became Lord Chancellor, the highest political office. It was as Lord Chancellor, at the pinnacle of his political career, that Bacon encountered a great scandal that  would  end  his  political  career  entirely,  making  way  for  his philosophical pursuits. In 1621, Francis Bacon, then–Lord Chancellor, was accused of accepting bribes and arrested. Bacon pled guilty to his charges and was fined £40,000 and sentenced to serve a prison sentence in the Tower of London. While his fine was waived and he would only spend four days in prison, Bacon would never be allowed to hold political office or sit in Parliament ever again, thus ending his political life. It was at this point in Francis Bacon’s life that he decided to dedicate the remainder of his life (five years) to philosophy.']...\n",

Bacon  argued  that through  the  advancement  of  science,  the  quality  of  human  life  could improve, and therefore, people should no longer rely on the work of ancient philosophers. Francis Bacon became so disillusioned with the philosophical thinking  of  his  time  that  he  categorized  the  thought  process  of  people  as four  categories  of  false  knowledge,  which  he  referred  to  as  “idols.”  The four idols were: 1. Idols of the tribe: These are the false notions that arise from human nature that are common to everyone. For example, human nature causes people to seek out evidence that supports their own conclusions, causes people to try to have things fit into patterns, and causes beliefs to be affected by what people want to believe. 2. Idols of the cave: These are interpretations that come about as a result of individual makeup and disposition. For example, some people might favor similarities while others favor differences, and some might favor notions that support their earlier conclusions. 3. Idols of the marketplace: These are false notions that arise from the use of language and words as a means to communicate with one another. For example, words can have a variety of meanings, and people have the ability to name and imagine things that do not actually exist. 4. Idols of the theater: Francis Bacon believed that philosophies weren’t any better than plays. To Bacon, sophistic philosophy like the work of Aristotle focused more on smart but foolish arguments rather than the natural world; empirical philosophy only focused on a small range of experiments and excluded too many other possibilities; and superstitious philosophy, which was philosophy established by religion and superstition, was a corruption of philosophy. To Francis Bacon, superstitious philosophy was the worst type of false notion.']...\n",

Gettier created a series of problems (based on actual  or  possible  situations)  where  an  individual  has  a  belief  that  ends  up being  true  and  has  evidence  to  support  it,  but  it  fails  to  actually  be knowledge. According  to  Plato,  in  order  for  one  to  have  knowledge  of  something, three conditions have to be satisfied. This is known as the tripartite theory of knowledge. According to the tripartite theory of knowledge, knowledge is when a true belief is justified. Therefore, if a person believes something to be true, and then  it  ends  up  being  true  through  justification,  then  that  person  knows  it. The three conditions of the tripartite theory of knowledge are: 1. Belief: A person can’t know something to be true without first believing that it is true. 2. Truth: If a person knows something, then it must be true. If a belief is false, then it cannot be true, and therefore, it cannot be known. 3. Justification: It is not enough to simply believe something to be true. There must be a justification through sufficient evidence. With  the  Gettier  problems,  Edmund  Gettier  was  able  to  show  that  the tripartite theory of knowledge was incorrect. While his problems differed in specific details, they all shared two similar characteristics: 1. While justification is present, the justification is fallible because there is the possibility that the belief could end up being false. 2. Each problem features luck. In all of the Gettier problems, the belief becomes justified; however, it is due to the presence of pure luck.']...\n",

Now,  instead  of  three  conditions  (which  can  be  looked  at  as  a triangle), knowledge has an extra condition (and is now viewed as a square). The four main theories are: 1. No False Belief Condition: This theory states a belief cannot be based on a belief that is false. For example, a watch stops working at 10 a.m., and you are unaware of this fact. Twelve hours later, at 10 p.m., you look at the watch. The time on the watch is actually correct, but your belief that the watch is working is incorrect. 2. Causal Connection Condition: Between knowledge and a belief, there has to be a causal connection. For example, consider the following situation. Tom believes Frank is in his bedroom. Tom sees Frank standing in his bedroom. Therefore, Tom is justified in his belief. Unknown to Tom, however, is the fact that Tom didn’t see Frank at all. Instead, it was Frank’s twin brother, Sam, who was standing and seen by Tom, and Frank is actually hiding underneath Tom’s bed. While Frank was in the room, it was not because Tom knew this. According to the causal connection condition, Tom shouldn’t be able to conclude that Frank is in the bedroom because there is no connection between seeing Sam and knowing Frank is in the room. 3. Conclusive Reasons Condition: A reason for a belief must exist that would not exist if the belief itself were false. For example, if a person believes there is a table in front of him, the reason would not exist if there was not a table in front of him. 4. Defeasibility Condition: This theory states that as long as there is not evidence pointing to the contrary, a belief is known. In the scenario with Tom, Frank, and Sam, Tom is entitled to say Frank is in the bedroom because he isn’t aware of evidence pointing to the contrary. While these four theories attempt to fix the tripartite theory of knowledge, they  also  have  their  problems.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  Edmund  Gettier’s work has become so influential.

At the age of twelve, Hume was sent to the University  of  Edinburgh,  where  he  developed  a  passion  for  classics  and spent the next three years studying philosophy and trying to create his own philosophical program. His studies proved to be extraordinarily taxing on Hume, and it began to compromise  his  psychological  health.  After  working  for  a  short  time  as  a clerk for a sugar importer, Hume finally recovered and moved to France to continue working on his own philosophical vision. Between 1734 and 1737, while  living  in  La  Flèche,  France,  Hume  wrote  one  of  his  most  impactful philosophical  works,  A  Treatise  of  Human  Nature.  This  work  was  later published  in  England  as  three  books  between  1739  and  1740,  with  Hume removing  parts  that  would  seem  controversial  for  the  time  (such  as  his discussion of miracles). Hume wanted to work in the British academic system. His Treatise was poorly  received,  however,  and  while  his  next  two-volume  compilation, Essays,  Moral,  Political,  and  Literary,  was  modestly  successful,  Hume’s reputation for being an atheist and skeptic ruined any chances of a career in education.']...\n",

Hume then also argues that when something is a “matter of fact,” it is a matter that has to be experienced and cannot be arrived at through instinct or reason. With  these  arguments,  Hume  takes  on  the  notion  of  God’s  existence, divine  creation,  and  the  soul.  According  to  Hume,  since  people  cannot experience  or  get  an  impression  from  God,  divine  creation,  or  the  soul, there is no real reason to believe in their existence. It  is  in  his  first  book  that  Hume  introduces  three  tools  used  for philosophical inquiry: the microscope, the razor, and the fork. Microscope: In order to understand an idea, one must first break down the idea into the simplest ideas that it is made up of. Razor: If a term cannot come from an idea that can be broken down into simpler ideas, then that term has no meaning. Hume uses the notion of the razor to devalue ideas such as metaphysics and religion. Fork: This is the principle that truths can be separated into two types. One type of truth states that once ideas (such as a true statement in math) are proven, they remain proven. The other truth relates to matters of fact and things that occur in the world.']...\n",

Hume classifies passions like he classifies  ideas  and  impressions.  He  first  makes  a  distinction  between original impressions, which are received through the senses, and secondary impressions, which come from original impressions. Original impressions are internal and from physical sources. They appear in the form of physical pains and pleasures and are new to us because they come from physical sources. According to Hume, the passions are found in the  world  of  secondary  impressions.  Hume  then  makes  the  distinction between direct passions (like grief, fear, desire, hope, joy, and aversion) and indirect passions (like love, hatred, pride, and humility). Hume states that morality is not based on reason because moral decisions affect  actions,  while  decisions  made  from  reason  do  not.  An  individual’s beliefs in regard to cause and effect are beliefs relating to the connections among  objects  that  people  experience.  The  actions  of  an  individual  are affected only when the objects are of interest, and they are only of interest to people if they have the ability to cause pain or pleasure. Therefore, Hume argues, pleasure and pain are what motivate people and create passions. Passions are feelings that initiate actions, and reason should act as a “slave” to passion. Reason can influence an individual’s actions in two  ways:  It  directs  passions  to  focus  on  objects,  and  it  discovers  the connections among events that will eventually create passions.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Based on the ideas he set forth in his first two books, Hume takes on the notion  of  morality.  First,  Hume  distinguishes  between  virtue  and  vice. Hume claims these moral distinctions are impressions, not ideas. While the impression of virtue is pleasure, the impression of vice is pain. These moral impressions  are  only  the  result  of  human  action  and  cannot  be  caused  by inanimate objects or animals. Hume argues that an individual’s actions are only determined to be moral or  immoral  based  on  how  they  affect  others  (and  not  how  they  affect  the individual). Therefore, moral impressions should only be considered from a social  point  of  view.  With  this  notion  in  mind,  Hume  claims  that  the foundation of moral obligation is sympathy. Morality is not a matter of fact that is the result of experience. Hume uses murder  as  an  example.  If  one  were  to  examine  murder,  one  would  not experience pain, and therefore, one couldn’t find the vice. You would only uncover your own dislike of murder. This shows that morality does not exist in reason, but rather, in passions. Because of David Hume’s criticism of philosophical theories, ideas, and methodologies  that  relied  heavily  on  rationalism,  he  became  one  of  the most  important  minds  in  Western  philosophy.  His  work  touched  on  an incredible number of philosophical topics, including religion, metaphysics, personal identity, morality, and concepts of cause-effect relations.']...\n",

The  Cyrenaics  emphasized  Socrates’  belief  that  happiness  is  one  of  the results of moral action, but also believed that virtue had no intrinsic value. They  believed  that  pleasure,  specifically  physical  pleasure  over  mental pleasure, was the ultimate good and that immediate gratification was more desirable than having to wait a long time for pleasure. Following the Cyrenaics was Epicureanism (led by Epicurus), which was a form of hedonism quite different from that of Aristippus. While he agreed that  pleasure  was  the  ultimate  good,  Epicurus  believed  that  pleasure  was attained through tranquility and a reduction of desire instead of immediate gratification. According to Epicurus, living a simple life full of friends and philosophical discussion was the highest pleasure that could be attained. During the  Middle  Ages,  hedonism  was  rejected  by  Christian philosophers because it did not mesh with Christian virtues and ideals, such as  faith,  hope,  avoiding  sin,  and  helping  others.  Still,  some  philosophers argued hedonism had its merits because it was God’s desire that people be happy. Hedonism  was  most  popular  in  the  eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries due to the work of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, who both argued for  variations  of  prudential  hedonism,  hedonistic  utilitarianism,  and motivational hedonism.']...\n",

Strong psychological hedonism (that is to say, absolutely all behavior is based on avoiding pain and gaining pleasure) has generally been dismissed by today’s philosophers. There is countless evidence to show that this is just simply  not  the  case  (like  when  a  seemingly  painful  act  is  done  out  of  a sense of duty), and it is generally accepted that decisions can be made based on motives that do not involve seeking pleasure or staying away from pain.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Normative hedonism, also known as ethical hedonism, is a theory that states that  happiness  should  be  sought  out.  Here,  the  definition  of  happiness  is “pleasure  minus  pain.”  Normative  hedonism  is  used  to  argue  theories  that deal with explaining how and why an action can be morally permissible or impermissible. Normative  hedonism  can  be  broken  down  into  two  types,  which  use happiness to decide whether an action is morally right or wrong: 1. Hedonistic Egoism: This theory states that people should act in the way that best suits their own interests, which would, in effect, make them happy. Consequences do not have to be considered (and have no value) for anyone other than the individual performing the action. However, under hedonistic egoism, desensitization needs to occur. If a person steals to suit his own interest, he should feel no difference between stealing from a rich or poor person. 2. Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory states that an action is right (morally permissible) when it produces or most likely produces the largest net happiness for everyone that it concerns. Utilitarianism thus pertains to the happiness of everyone who could be affected and not just an individual (everyone is given equal weight). According to hedonistic utilitarianism, stealing from the poor would be morally impermissible because it would leave the poor person unhappy and the thief would only be slightly happier (and if he feels guilty, his happiness is even less). Though hedonistic utilitarianism seems like an appealing theory because it  treats  everybody  equally,  it  has  faced  criticism  for  holding  no  intrinsic moral value to things like friendship, justice, truth, etc. Consider  this  example:  A  child  is  murdered  in  a  small  town.  The  town believes  your  best  friend  is  the  murderer,  but  you  know  he  is  innocent.  If the only way to promote the greatest happiness for everyone is to kill your best  friend,  according  to  hedonistic  utilitarianism,  you  should  do  so.  It doesn’t matter that the killer is still out there—all that matters is the largest net  happiness,  which  would  be  realized  by  killing  whoever  the  town believes is the suspect.']...\n",

If both A and B confess, they will both have to face some jail time (though a shorter sentence than the one faced by the person who did not speak). If both prisoner A and B remain silent, they will both face an even shorter prison sentence. For example: According to this diagram, if prisoner A and prisoner B both confess, they will each have to serve six years. If prisoner A remains quiet while prisoner B confesses (which implicates prisoner A in the process), prisoner A has to serve  ten  years  while  prisoner  B  can  go  home.

When  he  was  just  five  years  old,  Aquinas  was  sent  to  the monastery Montecassino to study with Benedictine monks. He would remain there  until  the  age  of  thirteen,  when,  due  to  great  political  unrest, Montecassino became a battle site and he was forced to leave. Aquinas was then transferred to Naples, where he studied at a Benedictine house that was affiliated with the University of Naples. There, he spent the next  five  years  learning  about  the  work  of  Aristotle  and  became  very interested  in  contemporary  monastic  orders.  In  particular,  Aquinas  became drawn to the idea of living a life of spiritual service, as opposed to the more traditional  and  sheltered  lifestyle  he  was  accustomed  to  seeing  with  the monks at Montecassino. Thomas  Aquinas  began  to  attend  the  University  of  Naples  around  1239. By 1243, he had joined an order of Dominican monks in secret, and received the habit in 1244. When his family learned of this, they kidnapped him, held him captive for a year, and tried to make him see the error of his ways. Their attempt did not work, however, and when he was released in 1245, Aquinas returned to the Dominican order. Between 1245 and 1252, Aquinas studied with  the  Dominicans  in  Naples,  Paris,  Cologne  (where  he  was  ordained  in 1950), and eventually returned to Paris to teach theology at the University of Paris. At  a  time  when  the  Catholic  Church  had  an  overwhelming  amount  of power  and  people  struggled  with  the  notion  of  having  philosophy  and religion  coexist,  Thomas  Aquinas  brought  faith  and  reasoning  together.

It  is  in  Part  1  that  Aquinas’s  most  famous philosophical  text,  the  Five  Ways,  is  found.  In  this,  Thomas  Aquinas  sets out to prove the existence of God. Aquinas  begins  by  acknowledging  that  though  philosophy  is  not  a requirement in promoting God’s knowledge, it can help theology. He then tries to answer the following questions: 1. Is “God exists” self-evident? 2. Can this be demonstrated? 3. Does God exist? Aquinas then provides five proofs that show the existence of God. With his  Five  Ways,  Thomas  Aquinas  combines  the  ideas  of  theology  with rational thought and observations from the natural world, in order to prove the existence of God.']...\n",

It is by living through these cardinal virtues that one moves toward true fulfillment. Aquinas made a distinction between an eternal happiness that could only be reached in the afterlife, and an imperfect happiness that could be reached in this life.

The Principle of Universal Causation: This states that every event has a cause. In other words, if “X causes Y” is true, then X and Y are events; X precedes Y; and if X happens, Y has to happen. 2. The Free Will Thesis: This states that sometimes people act freely. 3. The Principle of Avoidability and Freedom: If a person acts freely, then he could have done something other than what he in fact did. Yet, if no one could have done anything other than what he in fact did, then no one ever acts freely. 4. The Auxiliary Principle: This asserts that if every event has a cause, then no one could have done anything other than what he in fact did. Therefore, if sometimes a person could have done something other than what he in fact did, then some events are uncaused. Though all four principles initially appear to be intuitively plausible and a case can be made for believing each, it is ultimately apparent that they are incompatible  with  one  another.  In  other  words,  not  all  principles  can  be true.  Much  philosophical  debate  has  subsequently  been  dedicated  to determining which of these principles are true and which are false. Hard  determinism  responds  to  this  incompatibility  of  the  principles  by accepting the principle of universal causation, the principle of avoidability and freedom, and the auxiliary principle as true and rejecting the free will thesis as false: Premise 1: Every event has a cause (principle of universal causation). Premise 2: If every event has a cause, then no one could have done anything other than what he in fact did (auxiliary principle, part one). Premise 3: If no one could have done anything other than what he in fact did, then no one ever acts freely (principle of avoidability and freedom, part two). Therefore, no one ever acts freely (denial of free will theory). Premise 1 is the thesis of determinism: Every event is subject to the law of causality. The rationale for this premise is its appeal to common sense; it seems  impossible  to  even  imagine  what  it  would  mean  for  an  event  to  be “uncaused.” Premise 2 defines causality: If an event is caused, then it must happen. If it must happen, then nothing else could have happened instead. Premise 3 simply expresses what is meant by “free.” Surely if an act must occur,  the  person  committing  the  act  has  no  choice  and  is  thus  not  acting freely.']...\n",

Premise 2: If sometimes we do what we choose to do, then sometimes we are acting freely. Premise 3: If sometimes we are acting freely, then hard determinism is false. Therefore, hard determinism is false. Premise 1 defines choice as a decision or mental event, and its rationale is  simple  observation;  we  see  people  making  choices  every  day.  For example, people choose what clothes to wear, what food to eat, what time to wake up, etc. Premise 2 defines “acting freely” as choosing what we do. If someone  chooses  to  do  something,  the  fact  that  he  is  making  a  choice means  that  he  is  acting  freely.  Premise  3  is  the  negation  of  hard determinism. Because the “argument from choice” is a valid argument, it seems at first to be a solid objection to hard determinism. Further analysis of its definition of  acting  freely,  however,  demonstrates  the  argument  to  be  unsound. Because the “argument from choice” does not deny that events are caused, each assertion that it makes is subject to the laws of causality. With this in mind, it becomes clear that the main problem with the argument is its leap from the first premise to the second. Though people do, indeed, make what appear to be choices about various aspects of their lives, it does not follow that they are acting freely. A choice is  a  caused  event.  Therefore,  a  person’s  choice  to  act  in  some  way  is  not, itself, the sole or first cause of that action; it is, rather, the last event in a set of  conditions  that  causes  the  action.  A  person  may  choose  to  wear  a  red shirt,  but  his  choice  to  do  so  is,  itself,  causally  determined.  Though  the causes  for  a  person’s  choice  are  “internal  and  invisible”  and  sometimes unknown, they do very much exist. A person’s brain had to react in exactly the  way  it  reacted  because  the  choice  it  made  was  a  determined  event. According to philosopher Paul Rée, the person chooses to wear a red shirt because  of  “causes  whose  historical  development  could  be  traced  back  ad infinitum.” Even if a person thinks he could have done otherwise, it is only under a different, though perhaps very slightly different, set of conditions or causes that he could have acted in a different manner. Therefore, because a choice is a caused event, it is predetermined and must happen. Because the choice must happen, it is not an act of free will.']...\n",

      "Header: Argument from Drive Resistance (Part 2)\n",
      "Content: ['A second argument against hard determinism is the “argument from drive resistance.” It is stated as such: Premise 1: Sometimes we resist our passions. Premise 2: If sometimes we resist our passions, then sometimes we are acting freely. Premise 3: If sometimes we are acting freely, then hard determinism is false. Therefore, hard determinism is false. Premise 1 is a simple observation; people have passions or desires to, for example,  commit  murder,  engage  in  adultery,  or  drive  recklessly.  People, however,  are  able  to  prevent  themselves  from  engaging  in  such  activities. Premise 2 gives a definition of “acting freely.” A person acts freely if he is able to choose to act in a way that does not yield to passions. This premise suggests  that  by  resisting  passions,  people  are  able  to  avoid  the  infinite number  of  historical  causes  and  to  ultimately  act  freely.  Premise  3  is  the negation of hard determinism. Like  the  “argument  from  choice,”  the  “argument  from  drive  resistance” does not deny that every event has a cause and for this reason is valid but unsound.  The  strongest  objection  to  this  argument  is  to  deny  Premise  2; though people are able to resist their passions, it does not follow that they are  acting  freely.  For  example,  a  person  may  resist  the  desire  to  commit murder. However, just as committing a murder has a cause, so too does not committing  a  murder.  The  person  may  resist  the  desire  to  murder  because another desire, such as not wanting to be punished for his actions, pitying the fate of his victim, etc., causes him to do so. A person can never resist all of  his  drives.  By  the  definition  of  free will  given  by  the  “argument  from drive  resistance,”  therefore,  a  person  is  never  acting  freely.  Additionally, resistance  is  equally  subject  to  the  laws  of  causality.  It  is  not  merely  the cause  of  not  murdering;  it  is  an  event  and  thus  the  effect  of  some  other cause.  If  a  person  happens  to  resist  committing  murder,  he  was predetermined to resist committing murder and could not have acted in any other way. Ultimately, resisting one’s drives does not free a person from the laws of causality.']...\n",

      "Header: Argument from Moral Responsibility (Part 2)\n",
      "Content: ['The  third  argument  against  hard  determinism  is  the  “argument  from moral responsibility.” It is stated as such: Premise 1: Sometimes we are morally responsible for our actions. Premise 2: If sometimes we are morally responsible for our actions, then sometimes we are acting freely. Premise 3: If sometimes we are acting freely, then hard determinism is false. Therefore, hard determinism is false. The  argument  defines  moral  responsibility  in  this  way:  X  is  morally responsible for action A if X deserves praise or blame for doing A. Premise 1 is a simple observation; it appeals to our common sense that if a person commits murder, he should be blamed and punished. If, on the other hand, a person  saves  another  person’s  life,  he  should  be  praised  for  doing  so. Premise 2 defines “acting freely.” If people deserve praise or blame for an action, it is only rational that they must have freely chosen to act in the way that  they  did.  For,  if  they  had  not  acted  freely,  then  they  would  not  be praised or blamed. Premise 3 is a negation of hard determinism. The “argument from moral responsibility,” like the two arguments before it, is valid yet unsound. It presupposes that to “deserve” praise or blame for an action, a person must be the only cause of that action. In other words, a person does not “deserve” praise if he is forced into (by the cause) an act of kindness and does not “deserve” blame if he is forced into an act of cruelty. However, because this argument accepts that events are caused, it must also accept  that  actions  that  seem  to  deserve  praise  or  blame  are,  themselves, caused events; a person cannot be the sole cause of an event. The  main  problem  with  this  argument,  therefore,  is  its  first  premise; though there are circumstances under which it may seem logical to praise or blame  a  person,  it  is  actually  not  the  case  that  a  person  is  ever  actually morally responsible for his actions. If a person commits murder, he had no choice  but  to  commit  murder.  The  murder  was  a  caused  event  and  had  to happen.  If  the  murder  had  to  happen,  then  the  murderer  does  not  deserve praise  or  blame  for  his  action.  To  argue  in  favor  of  moral  responsibility, therefore,  would  be  to  claim  that  some  events  are  uncaused,  a  notion  that goes against our common sense. Many  philosophers  have  responded  to  the  rejection  of  Premise  1  by highlighting the implications it has for our current justice system. If we are to  deny  that  moral  responsibility  exists,  they  say,  then  we  have  no justification for punishment and we must, therefore, abolish the use of any prison or detention center. A hard determinist would see this conclusion as rash;  though  moral  responsibility  may  not  exist,  there  are  certainly  other deserving justifications for punishment. For instance, the prison system can serve as a safety precaution, a violence deterrent, a center for rehabilitation, or to satisfy victim grievances. The very fact that events are caused allows for the belief that prisons may well be the cause of a reduction in violence. The desire not to be punished could be an event in a set of conditions that prevents a person from killing another person. Hard  determinism  asserts  that  nothing  happens  without  a  cause,  that  no act  is  free  from  the  law  of  causality.  Though  there  are  many  arguments against this theory, they ultimately fail to disprove hard determinism.']...\n",

The Academy of Dijon  held  an essay  contest  based on the question of whether or not the restoration of the sciences and arts had the  tendency  to  purify  morals,  and  Rousseau,  who  won  the  prize,  argued that morals and goodness were corrupted by the advancement of civilization (an  idea  that  would  be  common  throughout  his  later  philosophical  texts). Rousseau  continued  to  produce  noteworthy  texts  (such  as  his  famous political text, Discourse on the Origin of Inequality) and grew in popularity. In 1762, however, his popularity came crashing down with the publication of his books The Social Contract and Èmile. The books were met with great controversy  and  outcry,  which  included  public  burnings  in  Paris  and Geneva, and the French monarchy ordered his arrest. Rousseau fled France and ultimately  resided in  the  Swiss town  of Neuchâtel, where  he not  only renounced his Genevan citizenship but also started working on his famous autobiography, Confessions. Rousseau  eventually  returned  to  France  and  sought  refuge  with  British philosopher  David  Hume.  On  July  2,  1778,  Rousseau  died  suddenly.  In 1794,  during  the  French  Revolution,  the  new  revolutionary  government, whose  views  were  vastly  different  than  the  monarchy’s,  ordered  that Rousseau’s  ashes  were  to  be  placed  in  the  Pantheon  in  Paris,  and  that  he was to be honored as a national hero. The  common  theme  throughout  most  of  Jean-Jacques  Rousseau’s important philosophical work relates to the ideas of freedom, morality, and the  state  of  nature.  His  work  laid  the  foundations  of  the  French  and American Revolutions and had an incredible impact on Western philosophy.']...\n",

      "Content: ['In  one  of  his  most  famous  political/philosophical  texts,  Discourse  on  the Origin of Inequality, Jean-Jacques Rousseau explains the essential elements of his philosophy. First, Rousseau lays out the different types of inequality that  exist  for  people.  He  then  takes  these  types  of  inequality  and  tries  to determine  which  are  “natural”  and  which  are  “unnatural”  (meaning  they could therefore be prevented). Rousseau believed that man, like every other animal found in nature, is motivated  by  two  principles:  self-preservation  and  pity.  In  man’s  natural state, man is happy, needs little, and knows nothing of good and evil. The only  thing  that  separates  man  from  any  other  animal  is  a  sense  (though unrealized) of perfectability. It  is  this  idea  of  perfectability  that  allows  man  to  change  over  time.  As humans socialize with other humans, the mind develops and reason begins to form. However, socialization also leads to a principle Rousseau refers to as “amour propre,” which is what drives humans to compare themselves to one  another  and  seek  domination  over  other  humans  in  order  to  create happiness. As  human  societies  become  more  complex  and  amour  propre  develops further,  things  like  private  property  and  labor  are  divided  amongst  the people, and this allows for the exploitation of the poor. The poor will then seek  to  end  such  discrimination  by  starting  a  war  with  the  rich.  However, the rich deceive the poor by creating a political society claiming to provide equality.  Equality  is  not  provided,  however,  and  instead,  oppression  and inequality become permanent fixtures in society.']...\n",

Yet  civil  society  acts  as  chains  and suppresses man’s inherent freedom. To  Rousseau,  the  only  legitimate  form  of  political  authority  is  one  in which all people have agreed upon a government with the intent of mutual preservation  through  a  social  contract.  Rousseau  refers  to  this  group  of people as a “sovereign.” The sovereign should always express the collective need  of  the  people  and  provide  for  the  common  good  of  everyone, regardless of individual opinions or desires (he calls this the “general will”). The general will also shapes the creation of laws. Rousseau does not dismiss the importance of government, however, and understood  that  there  would  be  friction  between  a  sovereign  and  a government (whether it be a monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy). To ease such  tensions,  Rousseau  claimed  the  sovereign  should  hold  periodic assemblies  and  vote  based  on  the  general  will.  The  assemblies  should always  be  attended  by  the  people  of  the  sovereign,  for  the  sovereignty  is lost  once  elected  representatives  attend  the  assemblies,  and  in  a  truly healthy  state,  the  votes  should  be  practically  unanimous.  Furthermore, Rousseau advocates that there should be a court to mediate conflicts among individuals, and among the government and the sovereignty. Jean-Jacques  Rousseau’s  The  Social  Contract  is  one  of  the  most important philosophical texts in Western philosophy. At a time of political inequality, Rousseau made it clear that the right of the government was to govern  by  “the  consent  of  the  governed.”  His  radical  ideas  regarding  the rights  of  man  and the  sovereignty  of the  people  are  frequently acknowledged  as  being  the  foundations  of  human  rights  and  democratic principles.']...\n",

Consequentialism  is  the  philosophical  view  that  an  action  is  morally  right when  it  produces  the  best  overall  consequences.  There  are  two  basic principles to consequentialism: 1. An act is right or wrong based solely on its results. 2. The more good consequences created from an act, the better and more right that act is. While  consequentialism  can  provide  guidance  for  how  one  should  live his life (we should live to maximize the amount of good consequences) and how to react during a moral dilemma (we should choose the action that will maximize the good consequences), consequentialism has been met with its fair share of criticism. In  consequentialism, it  proves  challenging to  predict future consequences.  How  does  one  go  about  assessing  the  morality  of  a consequence?  Should  it  be  based  on  what  an  individual  believed  would happen,  or  should  it  be  based  on  what  actually  happened?  There  are  also issues  with  how  to  measure  and  compare  consequences  that  are  morally “good.”  According  to  hedonism,  a  form  of  consequentialism,  good  is measured  by  pleasure,  while in  utilitarianism,  another type  of consequentialism, good is measured by well-being and welfare. In the case of the trolley problem, we begin to see how consequentialism unravels. In the first case, one form of utilitarianism claims pulling the lever is,  morally  speaking,  the  better  choice.  However,  another  type  of utilitarianism  claims  that  since  something  morally  wrong  is  already happening, participating by pulling the lever would also be morally wrong because  you  are  now  partially  responsible  for  the  death  of  a  person  or persons, whereas before, you were not. In the case of the second scenario, many people who were willing to pull the lever were not willing to throw the fat man over the bridge. While the consequences  in  both  situations  remain  the  same  (you  choose  to  save  the five  people  and  one  person  dies),  there  seems  to  exist  a  moral  difference between  simply  pulling  the  lever  and  actually  throwing  a  person  over  a bridge.']...\n",

      "Header: THE DOCTRINE OF DOUBLE EFFECT (Part 2)\n",
      "Content: ['The problem of the trolley is based on a principle known as the doctrine of double  effect.  This  principle,  first  introduced  by  Thomas  Aquinas,  is  the notion  that  an  action  can  be  morally  permissible  even  when  one  of  the consequences  is  morally  bad.  The  bad  consequence  of  these  actions  is foreseen, like in the problem of the trolley, where you realize ahead of time that one man will die if the lever is pulled. So if harming others is considered immoral, and we can foresee that one of  the  consequences  involves  harming  another  person,  is  the  person  who pulls the lever morally wrong? According  to  the  doctrine  of  double  effect,  an  individual  can  morally perform  an  action  that  leads  to  foreseen  harmful  consequences  if  the following four conditions are met: 1. There must be intention for the good consequence. The good consequence should never be used as an excuse for the bad consequence, so there should never be the intention to have the bad consequence occur. 2. The action itself must be morally neutral or good, and never morally wrong. So if you were to isolate the action from the good and bad consequences, it should never be bad. 3. The good consequence must be the direct result of the action, and not the result of the bad consequence. A morally good consequence can never occur because the action initially created a bad consequence. 4. The bad consequence can never outweigh the good consequence. Even if the intent was good, if the result leads to the bad consequence overpowering the good consequence, then this condition has been violated. A  common  real-life  example  of  the  doctrine  of  double  effect  is  when someone  is  killed  out  of  self-defense.  If  someone  kills  his  attacker,  the action is morally permissible because the good consequence outweighs the foreseen bad consequence (killing another person). The  doctrine  of  double  effect  is  rejected  by  consequentialists  because according  to  consequentialism,  there  is  no  relevance  to  what  a  person intended; only the consequences of his actions matter. To  this  day,  the  questions  of  morality  proposed  by  the  trolley  problem continue to spark debate in the philosophical world.']...\n",

To Plato, universals (which he refers to as Forms) are immaterial and exist outside of space and time. 2. Strong Realism: This form of realism rejects Plato’s idea of Forms, and instead claims that universals not only exist in space and time; they can also exist in many entities at the same time. The redness in the apple and cherry is actually the same universal redness, and not distinct from entity to entity.

Premise 2: If universals are extremely odd entities, then they don’t exist. Premise 3: If universals don’t exist, then realism is false. Therefore, realism is false. In The Problems of Philosophy, Russell describes a relation between two places:  “Edinburgh  is  north  of  London.”  This  relation  seems  to  exist independently of human perception. Russell asserts, however, that there are objections  against  this  conclusion;  antirealists  (those  who  subscribe  to  the belief that there is nothing outside of the mind and even if there were, we would not be able to access it) claim that universals do not exist in the same sense as physical objects or particulars. While it is easy to say where and when London exists (on a specific part of the earth, from the time it was created until the time it is destroyed), it is impossible  to  say  the  same  of  the  relation  “north  of”  because  that  entity does not exist in time or space. Therefore, as stated by the first premise of the  argument,  it  is  rational  to  believe  that  universals  are  very  strange entities. The argument goes on to say that because universals are odd in that they do not exist in any spatiotemporal sense, it follows that universals do not exist at all (Premise 2). Because it is impossible to know when or where a universal is, it is logical to deny its existence. If universals do not exist, then  the  theory  that  claims  they  do  exist,  realism,  is  false  (Premise  3). Premise 3 is the negation of realism. Because the “argument from oddity” is a valid argument, it seems at first to  be  a  solid  objection  to  realism.  Further  analysis  of  its  definition  of existence,  however,  demonstrates  the  argument  to  be  far  less  sound.  The main  problem  with  the  argument  is  its  leap  from  the  first  premise  to  the second. Though universals may indeed be odd in that they don’t exist in a spatiotemporal realm, it does not mean that they do not exist at all. It may seem  rational  to  view  spatiotemporal  existence  as  the  only  type  of existence, but this is not the case. Indeed, while physical objects, thoughts, emotions,  etc.,  exist,  universals  can  be  said  to  subsist.  Universals  subsist rather than exist (meaning they exist without space or time), says Russell, because they are timeless and unchangeable. Ultimately, though universals exist in an odd way, they do, indeed, exist.']...\n",

Premise 2: If there are universals, then it is possible to individuate universals. Premise 3: It is not possible to individuate universals. Therefore, realism is not true. To individuate a universal means to know of a “criterion of identity” for that universal. In other words, to individuate a universal means to know a necessarily true, noncircular statement of the form. The  first  premise  simply  states  the  theory  of  realism.  Premise  2  asserts that if universals exist, then it must be possible to know their form (in the same way one can say, for example, X is the same event as Y if and only if X and Y share the same cause and effect). When attempting to individuate a universal,  the  result  becomes  a  circular  argument,  therefore  proving Premise 3 to be true. Like  the  “argument  from  oddity,”  the  “problem  of  individuation”  is  a valid  but  unsound  argument.  It  may  very  well  be  the  case  that  universals can,  indeed,  be  individuated,  but  we  have  not  yet  determined  a  way  to articulate their form. Unless the “problem of individuation” can prove that universals  absolutely  cannot  be  individuated  at  any  point  in  the  future, rather than simply stating that they have not been individuated in the past, the argument has no logical merit.']...\n",

Born  on  April  22,  1724,  in  Königsberg,  East  Prussia,  Kant  came  from  a large  and  modest  family.  As  Kant  grew  older,  the  popular  Protestant movement  Pietism  played  a  large  role  in  his  family’s  life  (and  would subsequently influence his later work). At eight years old, Kant attended the Collegium Fridericianum, where he studied classicism. Kant remained there until 1740, when he enrolled in the University of Königsberg, studying mathematics and philosophy. When his father died in 1746, Kant found himself suddenly without money and began to take work as a private tutor to pay for his education. He worked as a tutor for seven years, and it was during this time that Kant published many of his philosophical ideas. Kant  worked  as  a  lecturer  at  the  University  of  Königsberg  for  fifteen years,  until  finally,  in  1770,  he  became  a  professor  in  logic  and metaphysics.  When  he  was  fifty-seven  years  old,  Kant  published  the Critique  of  Pure  Reason,  which  is  one  of  the  single  most  important philosophical texts ever written. In his book, Kant detailed how the human mind organizes experiences in two ways: how the world appears, and how one thinks about the world. Kant continued to teach at the University of Königsberg and write major philosophical  texts  for  the  next  twenty-seven  years.  However,  as  word spread of his unorthodox methods of teaching religious texts, the Prussian government  began  to  pressure  Kant.  In  1792,  the  king  of  Prussia  barred Immanuel  Kant  from  writing  about  and  teaching  religious  subjects,  which Kant obeyed until the king’s death five years later.

How can we infer cause and effect when we cannot experience (see, smell, touch, etc.) the law of causation? Kant makes a distinction between two types of propositions: 1. Analytic proposition: This is when the concept is contained within the subject. For example, “all squares have four corners.” In this sentence, four corners is part of the definition of a square. 2. Synthetic proposition: This is when the concept is not contained within the subject. For example, “all women are happy.” In this sentence, happiness is not part of the definition of a woman. Kant then makes a distinction between two more propositions: 1. a priori proposition: This is when the justification of a proposition does not rely on any experience. For example, “8 + 6 = 14” or “all mice are rodents.” 2. a posteriori proposition: This is when the justification of a proposition relies on experience. For example, the proposition “all women are happy” requires experience to say whether or not it is true. Kant  asks  how  synthetic  a  priori  knowledge  can  be  possible  (in  other words, how one can know something is universal and necessary without it being  definitional  or  self-evident).  Kant  concludes  that  synthetic  a  priori knowledge is in fact possible. And here’s how: According to Kant, experience is organized in our mind based on certain categories.  These  categories  then  become  features  of  experience  that  are both  necessary  and  universal.  For  example,  it  is  not  that  we  can’t  find causation  in  nature.  Rather,  causation  is  a  feature  in  our  minds,  so  we always  perceive  it.  We  can’t  not  find  causation.

According  to  Kant,  since  we  have  the  ability  to deliberate  and  provide  reasons  for  an  action,  moral  judgment  should  be placed on those reasons why an action was performed. While it is important that our actions have good consequences and we should always try for that result, consequences are not affected by reason, and therefore, reason is not completely responsible for the consequences of a particular action that was endorsed by reason. Reason  can  only  be  held  accountable  for  endorsing  a  particular  action. Therefore,  we  can  only  judge  motives  and  actions  as  being  moral  or immoral.  Since  morality  is  determined  from  reason,  this  means  that goodness and badness also stem from reason. Kant claims that acting badly is violating the maxims created from one’s own personal reason, or creating maxims that cannot consistently be viewed as  universal  laws.  In  other  words,  badness  is  the  result  of  laws  of  reason being  violated.  From  this  notion,  we  can  conclude  that  immorality  is actually a type of irrationality because the laws of reason are being violated.

According to dualism, the mind and body are two separate things. While the body (or matter) is the physical substance that an individual is made of, the mind (or soul) is a nonphysical substance that exists apart from the body and includes consciousness. There are three major types of dualism: 1. Substance Dualism: Substance can be broken down into two categories: mental and material. According to René Descartes, who made this theory famous, the material substance does not have the ability to think, and the mental substance has no extension in the physical world. 2. Property Dualism: The mind and body exist as properties of one material substance. In other words, consciousness is the result of matter being organized in a specific way (like the human brain). 3. Predicate Dualism: In order to make sense of the world, there needs to be more than one predicate (the way we go about describing a proposition’s subject). According to predicate dualism, mental predicates cannot be reduced into physical predicates. For example, in the sentence “Troy is annoying,” one cannot reduce the act of “being annoying” into a physical thing (predicate). “Annoying” cannot be defined by its structure or composition, and it can look different in different situations.']...\n",

Additionally,  the  theory  of  causal  interaction  deals  with  how  an interaction occurs between the mental and the physical. Let’s say you move your arm up and down. To do so, you first have the intention to move your arm up and down (the mental event). The message travels via neurons, and then  you  move  your  arm  up  and  down.  However,  the  mental  event  of intending to move your arm is not enough to move your arm. There must be a  force  that  makes  the  neurons  send  the  message.

In  his  book, Bentham created the principle of utility, in which an action is approved of when it has the tendency to provide and enable the most happiness. According to Bentham, happiness is defined as the presence of pleasure and  the  absence  of  pain.  He  created  a  formula,  known  as  the  felicific (meaning  “happiness-making”)  calculus,  with  which  to  measure  the  value of  different  pleasures  and  pains.  When  measuring  pleasure  and  pain, Bentham  looks  at  duration,  intensity,  certainty  versus  uncertainty,  and nearness versus farness. Bentham then reasons that what makes an act right is the extent to which it increases the pleasure and decreases the pain. His theory is identified as hedonistic because it believes pleasure and pain to be the only things of value and is referred to as “act utilitarianism” because it applies utility directly to actions. For  Bentham,  utilitarianism  was  based  on  the  consequences  of  actions that  were  taken.  Most  importantly,  Bentham  emphasized  the  happiness  of the  community  as  the  most  important  thing,  since  the  happiness  of  the community is the sum of the happiness of the individual people within the community.  Therefore,  the  principle  of  utility  determined  that  the  moral obligation to perform an action was based on doing whatever produced the greatest amount of happiness in the largest number of people affected by the action.  For  Bentham,  it  was  about  quantity  over  quality.  No  matter  how complex or simple the pleasure, each was treated the same. Bentham firmly believed more, quantitatively speaking, is better.']...\n",

While  Mill  agreed  with  and  enhanced  much  of  Bentham’s  theory,  he disagreed with the belief that quantity of pleasure is better than quality. Mill noted  that, with  Bentham’s disregard  for  qualitative  differences, there was no difference between the value of a human’s pleasure and the value of an animal’s  pleasure.  Thus,  the  moral  status  of  humans  is  the  same  as  the moral status of animals. While  Mill  believed  that  pleasures  differed  in  quality,  he  proved  that quality  could  not  be  quantified  (thus  showing  that  Bentham’s  felicific calculus  was  unreasonable).  To  Mill,  only  those  people  who  had experienced high pleasures and low pleasures would be able to judge their quality,  and  this  process  would  lead  to  the  creation  of  a  moral  worth  that would  promote  higher  pleasures  (which  he  believed  were  mostly intellectual),  even  if  the  lower  pleasures  (which  he  believed  were  mostly bodily) were momentarily more intense. According  to  Mill,  happiness  is  difficult  to  attain.  Thus,  instead  of seeking pleasure, people are morally justified to instead seek out a way to reduce  their  total  amount  of  pain  with  their  actions.  Mill’s  form  of utilitarianism  also  allowed  for  the  ability  to  sacrifice  pleasure  and experience pain if the result is for the greater good of everyone. Mill  responds  to  critics  who  claim  that  utilitarianism  asks  too  much  of people by explaining that most good actions are not intended for the world’s benefit,  but  for  the  benefit  of  individuals  who  make  up  the  world.

Not  only  can  it  prove challenging  under  act  utilitarianism  to  have  a  complete  knowledge  of  the consequences of one’s actions; the principle also allows for immoral acts to be  justified.  For  example,  if  there  is  a  war  between  two  countries  and  the war  can end by finding  the  whereabouts  of one man  who is  in  hiding, act utilitarianism states that torturing the man’s child, who knows of his father’s location, would be morally justified.']...\n",

Rule  utilitarianism  states  that  an  action  is  morally  correct  based  on  the correctness of its rules. When a rule is correct and followed, the result is the greatest amount of good or happiness that can be attained. According to rule utilitarianism, while following the rules may not lead to the greatest overall happiness, not following the rules will not either. Rule  utilitarianism  also faces  criticism.  For  example, in rule utilitarianism, it is entirely possible to create rules that are unjust. A perfect real-world example is slavery.

No  matter  the  type  of  utilitarianism,  neither  form appears  to  require  an  absolute  ban  on  lying,  cheating,  or  stealing.  Indeed, utilitarianism seems at times to require that we lie, cheat, or steal so long as it is the route by which maximum happiness is achieved (though according to  rule  utilitarianism,  activities  like  lying,  cheating,  and  stealing  would undermine  the  trust  upon  which  human  society  is  founded,  and  any  rule which  permits  these  actions  cannot  maximize  utility  if  it  is  universally adopted). In utilitarianism, morality is always based on the consequences that arise as  a  result  of  an  action,  and  never  based  on  the  actual  action.  Because  of this  focus  on  consequences  rather  than  intentions,  the  moral  worth  of  an action  seems  to  become  a  matter  of  luck.  The  final  consequences  of  an action must become evident before it can be determined whether the action was  good  or  bad.

Furthermore,  because  it  is necessary  to  determine  how  many  people  will  be  affected,  how  intensely they  will  be  affected,  and  the  effect  of  any  available  alternatives, utilitarianism  leaves  much  room  for  miscalculation.  Therefore,  though utilitarianism does an adequate job of banning deceitful behavior, it seems to be a weak moral theory.']...\n",

Locke’s father, a lawyer who also served as a captain in the English Civil War, was well connected with the English government. As a result, Locke was able to receive an outstanding and diverse education. In 1647,  while  attending  Westminster  School  in  London,  Locke  was  named King’s  Scholar  (an  honor  bestowed  upon  only  a  select  few),  and  in  1652, Locke attended Oxford’s most prestigious school, Christ Church. It was at Christ Church that John Locke became familiar with metaphysics and logic, and while pursuing his Master of Arts, he immersed himself in the work of Descartes  and  Robert  Boyle  (who  is  considered  to  be  the  father  of chemistry) and pursued a career as a doctor. In 1665, Locke became friends with Lord Ashley (who was a founder of the  Whig  party  and  would  go  on  to  become  Earl  of  Shaftesbury),  one  of England’s most skilled statesmen, who came to Oxford looking for medical treatment. Lord Ashley invited Locke to live in London and work for him as  his  personal  physician,  and  Locke  moved  there  in  1667.  As  Lord Ashley’s power and responsibility grew, so too did Locke’s responsibilities, and he soon found himself working in trading and colonization. One project Lord  Ashley  took  on  was  the  colonization  of  the  Carolinas  in  the  New World, and Locke took part in writing the constitution for the land. It was during  this  time  that  Locke  started  to  become  interested  in  philosophical discussions. In  1674,  with  Lord  Ashley  no  longer  in  government,  Locke  returned  to Oxford  to  get  a  bachelor  of  medicine  degree  and  then  traveled  to  France, where  he  spent  a  lot  of  his  time  learning  about  Protestantism.  Upon returning  to  England  in  1679,  Locke  found  himself  embroiled  in controversy. As Charles II and Parliament fought for control and revolution seemed  possible,  Locke’s  involvement  in  a  failed  assassination  attempt  of the  king  and  the  king’s  brother  forced  Locke  to  leave  the  country.  It  was during this time that Locke also wrote the highly regarded Two Treatises of Government. While living in exile in Holland, Locke finished perhaps what is his most famous work, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, which he had started while in France. Locke was finally able to return to England in 1688, when  William  of  Orange  invaded  England,  forcing  James  II  (who  ruled after  his  brother,  Charles  II,  died)  to  flee  to  France,  starting  the  Glorious Revolution.  It  was  only  after  Locke’s  return  to  England  that  An  Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Two Treatises of Government were published. The Glorious Revolution had a profound impact on England and shifted power  away  from  the  monarchy  and  toward  Parliament.  John  Locke  was not  only  considered  to  be  a  hero  during  his  time;  his  contributions  to Western  philosophy  have  proven  that  he  is  one  of  the  greatest  minds  of touched  on  empiricism, human  history.

In Essay, Locke provides a systematic philosophy that attempts to answer the question  of  how  we  think.  As  a  result  of  his  work,  Locke  shifted  the philosophical dialogue away from metaphysics and toward epistemology. Locke opposes the notion set forth by other philosophical schools (such as those of Plato and Descartes) that one is born with innate, fundamental principles and knowledge. He argues that this idea would mean all humans universally  accept  certain  principles,  and  since  there  are  no  universally accepted principles (and if there were, they would not be the result of innate knowledge), this cannot be true. For example, people differ in moral ideas, so moral knowledge cannot be innate.  Instead,  Locke  believed  that  humans  are  a  tabula  rasa,  or  blank slate,  that  gain  knowledge  through  experience.  The  experience  creates simple  ideas  (based  on  the  senses,  reflection,  and  sensation),  and  as  these simple  ideas  combine,  they  become  more  complex  (through  comparison, abstraction,  and  combination)  and  form  knowledge.  Ideas  can  also  be divided into two categories: 1. Primary (which cannot be separate from the matter and are present regardless of whether a person sees them or not—for example, size, shape, and motion) 2. Secondary (which are separate from the matter and are only perceived when the matter is observed—for example, taste and odor) Lastly,  Locke  objects  to  Plato’s  concept  of  essences,  the  notion  that humans can only identify an individual to be part of a species because of its essence.  Locke  creates  his  own  theory  of  essences  based  on  observable properties  (which  he  calls  nominal  essences)  and  the  invisible  structures that  form  the  observable  properties  (which  he  calls  real  essences).  For example,  we  can  form  an  idea  and  create  an  essence  about  what  a  dog  is based  on  what  we  observe  and  based  on  the  biology  of  the  dog  (which  is responsible for the observable properties). To Locke, human knowledge is limited, and humans should be aware of such limitations.']...\n",

      "Content: ['In  his  Two  Treatises  of  Government,  Locke  details  his  beliefs  on  human nature  and  politics.  The  anchor  to  Locke’s  political  philosophy  was  the notion that humans have the right to private property. According to Locke, when God created man, man only had to live by the laws  of  nature,  and  as  long  as  peace  was  preserved,  one  could  do  as  he pleased. Man’s right to self-preservation meant that man also had the right to  have  the  things  that  are  needed  in  order  for  one  to  survive  and  live happily; and those have been provided by God. Since man is the owner of his own body, any product or good that is the result of his physical labor should also belong to him. A man who decides to farm and create food, for example, should therefore be the owner of that land  and the  food produced  from the  land.  According  to  Locke’s ideas  on private  property,  one  should  not  take  possession  of  something  if  another individual  is  harmed  in  the  process  because  God  wants  everyone  to  be happy, and man should not take more than he needs, for that could be used by another person. Since immoral people exist, however, man should create laws to ensure and protect his rights to property and freedoms. It is the sole purpose of government, Locke believed, to support the well- being of everyone. And though some natural rights are surrendered when a government  is  established,  a  government  has  the  ability  to  protect  rights more effectively than one person could alone. If the government no longer supports  the  well-being  of  everyone,  it  should  be  replaced,  and  it  is  the moral obligation of the community to revolt. According to Locke, if a proper government exists, both individuals and societies  should  flourish  not  only  materially,  but  spiritually.  The government should provide a freedom that aligns with the self-perpetuating natural law created by God. Though  published  later  in  his  life,  once  Locke  had  returned  to  England after living in exile, Two Treatises of Government was written during a time of  great  political  tension  between  the  monarchy  and  Parliament.  Locke believed that there could be a greater type of government, and his political philosophy had a profound impact on Western philosophy.']...\n",

Any knowledge that is gained from the intuition/deduction thesis is a  priori,  meaning  it  has  been  gained  independent  of  the  senses,  and rationalists have used it to explain mathematics, ethics, free will, and even metaphysical claims like the existence of God.']...\n",

According  to  the  innate  concept  thesis, some  knowledge  is  not  the  result  of  experience;  however,  sensory experience  can  trigger  the  process  that  brings  this  knowledge  to  our consciousness.  While  experience  can  act  as  a  trigger,  it  still  does  not provide  concepts  or  determine  what  the  information  is.  This  concept  is different from the innate knowledge thesis because here, knowledge can be deduced  from  innate  concepts.  With  the  innate  concept  thesis,  the  more removed a concept is from experience, the more plausible it is to claim it as innate. For example, a concept on geometric shapes would be more innate than  a  concept  on  experiencing  pain  because  it  is  further  removed  from experience. While empiricism and rationalism present two different explanations for the same question, the answers are sometimes not as black and white. For example,  philosophers  Gottfried  Wilhelm  Leibniz  and  Baruch  Spinoza, considered  to  be  key  figures  in  the  rationalism  movement,  believed  that knowledge could  be gained  through  reason  in  principle.

Hegel enrolled in the seminary at the University of Tübingen in 1788 and studied theology. During his time at the University, Hegel became friends  with  Friedrich  Hölderlin  and  Friedrich  W.  J.  von  Schelling,  who would  go  on  to  become  incredibly  successful  as  a  poet  and  philosopher, respectively. Throughout their lives, these three men would have profound impacts on one another’s work. After graduating, Hegel decided he would not pursue being a pastor and lived in Frankfurt, where he worked as a tutor. When his father died, Hegel was  left  with  enough  money  to  financially  support  himself  and  began  to devote his time entirely to working on his religious and social philosophies. In 1800, Hegel was introduced to the work of Immanuel Kant and became very  interested  in  Kant’s  philosophies.  In  1801,  Hegel  moved  with  von Schelling  to  the  city  of  Jena,  where  both  were  hired  to  teach  at  the University of Jena. Jena was an artistic and intellectual epicenter, and Hegel decided his philosophy would combine his influences of theology, Kantian idealism,  and  romanticism  with  contemporary  politics  and  social  issues. That same year, Hegel began publishing his philosophical texts. Hegel published one of his most famous works, Phenomenology of Spirit, in 1807, in which he discussed in depth his views on Spirit, consciousness, and  knowledge.  Hegel  would  later  systematize  his  philosophical  approach in  his  three-volume  Encyclopedia  of  the  Philosophical  Sciences  of  1817 and, in 1821, his Elements of the Philosophy of Right, where he combined his  philosophical  ideas  with  critiques  of  modern  society  and  political institutions. In the years leading up to his death, Hegel became quite influential. The impact of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel can be seen in theology, cultural theory,  and  sociology,  and  his  work  is  often  considered  a  precursor  to Marxism.']...\n",

Hegel,  however,  used  the  word dialectic in a very different way. Like Kant, Hegel was an idealist. Hegel believed the mind only has access to ideas of what the world is like, and that we can never fully perceive what the world is. However, unlike Kant, Hegel believed these ideas were social, meaning  they  are  completely  shaped  by  other  people’s  ideas.  Through  the use of a common language, traditions of one’s society, and the religious and cultural institutions that one belongs to, an individual’s mind is shaped. This collective  consciousness  of  a  society,  which  Hegel  refers  to  as  “Spirit,”  is responsible for shaping one’s consciousness and ideas. Hegel,  unlike  Kant,  believed  that  this  Spirit  is  constantly  evolving. According to Hegel, the spirit evolves by the same kind of pattern as an idea would  during  an  argument,  the  dialectic.  First,  there  is  an  idea  about  the world  (much  like  a  thesis),  which  has  an  inherent  flaw,  giving  rise  to  the antithesis.  The  thesis  and  antithesis  eventually  reconcile  by  creating  a synthesis, and a new idea arises comprised of elements of both the thesis and the antithesis. To  Hegel,  society  and  culture  follow  this  pattern,  and  one  could understand all of human history, without the use of logic or empirical data, simply by using logic.']...\n",

Hegel  adds  to  this  theory  by  stating  that  self- consciousness  not  only  involves  an  object  and  a  subject;  it  also  involves other subjects because individuals truly become aware of themselves when someone  else  is  watching.  Therefore,  according  to  Hegel,  actual  self- consciousness  is  social.  It  is  only  when  another  consciousness  is  present that one views the world from another’s eyes in order to get a self-image. Hegel likens this to relationships of inequality and dependence, where the subordinate  in  the  relationship  (known  as  the  bondsman)  is  consciously aware  of  his  status,  while  the  independent  partner  (known  as  the  lord)  is able  to  enjoy  the  freedom  of  not  being  concerned  about  the  bondsman’s consciousness. However, this creates feelings of guilt for the lord because in order  to  have  this  superiority,  he  must  deny  the  bondsman  mutual identification.

Prior to the Enlightenment, people were regarded by their  social  hierarchies.  However,  the  Enlightenment,  and  its  key  players like  Locke,  Rousseau,  Kant,  and  Hobbes,  placed  emphasis  on  the individual. Hegel believed the modern state would correct the imbalance set forth by modern culture, and believed institutions were needed that would be able to preserve  freedom  while  affirming  ethical  life  and  common  bonds.  For example,  Hegel  believed  it  was  the  state’s  job  to  provide  for  the  poor, regulate the economy, and create institutions based on different occupations (almost like present-day trade unions) so that people can experience a sense of social belonging and a connectivity to a society at large.']...\n",

His  father  was  an  aristocrat  who placed great importance on giving his children a good education. At eight years old, Descartes was sent to a Jesuit boarding school, where he would become familiar with logic, rhetoric, metaphysics, astronomy, music, ethics, and natural philosophy. At  twenty-two  years  old,  Descartes  earned  his  law  degree  from  the University  of  Poitiers  (where  some  believe  he  had  a  nervous  breakdown) and  began  studying  theology  and  medicine.  He  did  not  pursue  them  long, however,  claiming  he  wanted  to  discover  the  knowledge  that  was  found within  himself  or  the  world.  He  enlisted  in  the  army,  where  he  travelled and, in his spare time, studied mathematics. Descartes ended up becoming acquainted  with  famous  philosopher  and  mathematician  Isaac  Beeckman, who was trying to create a method that could link physics and mathematics. On  the  night  of  November  10,  1619,  Descartes  had  three  dreams,  or visions, that would change the course of his life and philosophy. From these complex  dreams,  Descartes  decided  he  would  devote  his  life  to  reforming knowledge  through  mathematics  and  science.  He  began  with  philosophy because it was the root of all other sciences. Descartes then began writing Rules for the Direction of the Mind, which outlined  his  new  method  of  thought.  The  treatise  was  never  finished— Descartes  only  completed  the  first  of  three  sections  (each  composed  of twelve rules). It was published posthumously in 1684.']...\n",

He  then  shows  how  his  rules could solve profound and complex problems, like the existence of  God,  dualism,  and  personal  existence  (where,  “I  think; therefore I am,” comes from). As Descartes continued to write, his fame grew. Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, published in 1641, tackled the objections of those who disputed  his  findings  in Discourse and introduced  a circular form of logic known  as  a  “Cartesian  circle.”  His  Principles  of  Philosophy,  published  in 1644  and  read  throughout  Europe,  attempted  to  find  the  mathematical foundation of the universe. While  living  in  Stockholm,  Sweden,  to  tutor  the  queen,  Descartes  died from pneumonia.

Descartes argues that thought and reason are the essence of humanity because while one cannot be sure of any other part of existence, one can always be certain that he has thoughts and reason. For thoughts to exist, there must be a source to do the thinking; therefore if one thinks,  one  has  to  exist.  To  Descartes,  humans  are  also  capable  of  reason, and without it, one would simply not be human. Descartes  believed  that  it  is  through  the  ability  to  reason  that  humans gain true knowledge and certainty in science. His assumption that reason is a natural talent gifted to all people led him to write about very complex and philosophical  matters  in  a  way  that  could  be  understood  by  all.  He  even sometimes wrote his works in French instead of Latin (the language used by scholars) so his work could be read by the masses. Descartes  presented  arguments  as  logical  trains  of  thought  that  anyone would be able to follow. He believed that any problem could be broken up into  its  simplest  parts  and  that  problems  could  be  conveyed  as  abstract equations.  By  doing  so,  one  is  able  to  remove  the  issue  of  sensory perception  (which,  according  to  Descartes,  is  unreliable)  and  allow  for objective reason to solve the problem. Since sensory perception was unreliable, the only thing Descartes could truly be sure of was that people are thinking things. Therefore, reason and thought  are  the  essence  of  all  people.

The property of being in the past, the present, or the future is a temporary, not permanent, property. For example, when it had not yet happened, the event of landing on the moon was in the future; when it was occurring, it was in the present; and now it is in the past. The “A-series” that McTaggart discusses thus establishes a flow of time, in  which  each  event  is  at  one  time  future,  at  one  time  present,  and  at  one time past, but never any combination of the three at once and never any of the three forever. No event is always present, always past, or always future. His definition also allows for the existence of varying degrees of past and future  (next  year  is,  for  example,  more  future  than  next  Tuesday)  and different properties that correspond to these different degrees. To talk about events as occurring in either the past, present, or future requires the use of A-sentences, or tensed sentences.

Presentism is the extreme assertion that only the present is real and that nothing exists other than  what  presently  exists.  For  example,  though  past  objects,  such  as dinosaurs,  did  exist,  there  is  no  sense  in  which  they  do  exist.  Similarly, while  it  is  possible  that  future  objects,  such  as  the  100th  president  of  the United States, will exist, it is not the case that they do exist. In this context, then, discussion of past or future objects is not a discussion of objects that exist  somewhere  other  than  the  present,  but  of  properties  that  did  or  will exist when other times were or will be present. The strength of presentism depends  upon  the  existence  of  tenses  and  is  thus  an  important  element  of the A-theory. Non-reductionism,  or  “taking  tense  seriously,”  is  the  idea  that  tense corresponds to a fundamental and ineliminable feature of reality. A tensed proposition, or an A-sentence, is one in which tenses (am, was, will, have, had, etc.) are used. An eternal proposition, or a B-sentence, conversely, is a tenseless  sentence.  Tenseless  sentences  use  words  such  as  before,  after,  is simultaneous with, or specify the date. Non-reductionists claim that tensed propositions  cannot  be  reduced  to  eternal  propositions  without  a  loss  of information. For  instance,  to  say  “I  believe  that  I  am  hungry”  does  not  preserve  the same  truth  value  if  a  date—“I  believe  that  I  am  hungry  at  3  p.m.  on  June 15”—is attached. A sincere statement of “I believe that I am hungry” entails “I believe that I am hungry simultaneously with my utterance,” whereas my statement of “I believe that I am hungry at 3 p.m. on June 15” does not. The A-sentence  is  true  only  when  it  is  simultaneous  with  my  saying  it.  The tenseless  sentence,  if  true,  is  true  at  every  point  in  time.  This  reveals  that tensed  propositions  (A-sentences)  convey  temporal  beliefs  that  cannot  be expressed by tenseless dated sentences.']...\n",

Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity (1905) consists of two postulates: 1. The speed of light is the same for all observers, no matter their relative speed. 2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial frames. It follows from these two postulates that simultaneity is not absolute but must,  instead,  be  relativized  to  an  inertial  frame.  For  any  pair  of  events, there can be no single fact of the matter as to which event happened first, or whether both occurred at the same time. The precedence of one event to the other  depends  upon  the  frame  of  reference:  Relative  to  one  frame  of reference, Event 1 might be simultaneous with Event 2; relative to another frame of reference, Event 1 might occur earlier than Event 2; and relative to a third frame of reference, Event 1 might occur later than Event 2. So, while two events might occur simultaneously for one observer, they will  occur  at  different  times  for  an  observer  moving  in  a  different  inertial frame. An event that is present relative to one frame of reference may well be past or future relative to another frame of reference.

A person traveling on the train regards  all  events  in  reference  to  the  train.  Two  strokes  of  lightning  occur, one at point A and one at point B. The distance between point A and point B is measured, and an observer is placed at the midpoint, M. The observer is given two mirrors inclined at 90° so that he can observe point A and point B at  the  same  time.  If  the  observer  sees  the  two  flashes  of  light  at  the  same time, the two strokes of lightning are simultaneous. The passenger, however, will see the light from B earlier than from A. Events that are simultaneous with reference to the embankment, then, are not simultaneous with reference to the train. As shown in this example, the absence of an absolute simultaneity poses a problem  for  the  A-theory  and  the  use  of  tenses.  If  the  special  theory  of relativity  is  correct,  existence  according  to  presentism  becomes  a  frame- dependent  matter.

Though his father disappeared when he was young, Hobbes’s uncle paid for his education, and by the time he was fourteen years old, Hobbes studied at Magdalen Hall in Oxford. In 1608, Hobbes left Oxford and became a tutor for the oldest son of Lord Cavendish of Hardwick. In 1631, while tutoring another family member of the Cavendish family, Hobbes began to focus on his  philosophical  ideas  and wrote his  first  published  piece, Short  Tract  on First Principles. Hobbes’s  association  with  the  Cavendish  family  proved  to  be  quite beneficial.  He  was  able  to  sit  in  on  parliamentary  debates;  contribute  to discussions about the king, landowners, and Parliament members; and get a firsthand look at how government was structured and influenced. During an incredibly tumultuous time between the monarchy and Parliament, Hobbes was a staunch monarchist and even wrote his first political philosophy, The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic, in defense of King Charles I. In the early 1640s, as the conflict escalated into what would become the English Civil  Wars  (1642–1651),  Hobbes  fled  the  country  and  moved  to  France, where  he  would  remain  for  eleven  years.  It  was  while  he  lived  in  France that Hobbes produced his most important work (including his most famous book, Leviathan, published two years after the execution of King Charles I). Thomas  Hobbes  was  an  incredibly  individualistic  thinker.  During  the English  Civil  Wars,  while  most  in  favor  of  the  monarchy  began  to  soften their arguments by expressing support for the Church of England, Hobbes, who  was  the  most  prominent  royalist,  proclaimed  his  distaste  for  the church,  which  led  him  to  become  banned  by  the  king’s  court.  Even  as  a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Hobbes did not believe the king’s right to  rule  was  from  God;  rather,  it  was  a  social  contract  agreed  upon  by  the people. Hobbes was convinced that there needed to be an overhaul of philosophy, and set out to make a totalizing philosophical system that could provide an agreed-upon  basis  for  absolutely  all  knowledge.  The  root  of  his philosophical  system  was  his  belief  that  all  phenomena  in  the  universe could  be  traced  back  to  matter  and  motion.  However,  he  rejected  that  the experimental  method  and  observation  of  nature  could  act  as  a  base  for knowledge. Instead, his philosophy was deductive and based everything on universally accepted “first principles.”']...\n",

Instead, he believed the purpose of philosophy  was  to  establish  a  system  of  truths  that  were  based  on foundational,  universal  principles  that  could  be  demonstrated  by  anyone through language and agreed upon by all. In  searching  for  a  philosophy  based  on  universal  principles,  Hobbes turned  to  geometry  as  a  model  and  claimed  it  to  be  the  first  universal principle.

So when he speaks of good and evil, he refers to “good” as anything people desire and “evil”  as  anything  people  avoid.  Based  on  these  definitions,  Hobbes  then goes  on  to  explain  various  behaviors  and  emotions.  Hope,  according  to Hobbes’s  definition,  is  the  possibility  of  gaining  some  apparent  good,  and fear  is  recognizing  that  an  apparent  good  cannot  be  attained  (though  this definition  is  only  maintainable  when  considering  humans  outside  of  the constraints of laws and society). Since good and evil are based on individual desires, rules regarding what makes something good or evil cannot exist. It  is  the  constant  back-and-forth  between  feelings  of  hope  and  fear  that Hobbes  believed  was  the  defining  principle  of  all  human  action,  and  he claimed that one of the two are present in all people at any given time. Hobbes  depicts  the  “state  of  nature”  as  humans  having  an  instinctive desire to gain as much good and power as they possibly can. This desire and a  lack  of  any  laws  that  prevent  one  from  harming  others  create  a  state  of constant  war.  And  this  constant  war  in  the  state  of  nature  means  humans must  be  living  in  constant  fear  of  one  another.  However,  when  reason  and fear combine, it makes humans follow the state of nature (the desire to gain as much good as one can) and makes humans seek out peace. Furthermore, good  and  evil  cannot  exist  until  a  society’s  supreme  authority  establishes these rules. Hobbes  claims  the  only  way  peace  can  truly  be  achieved  is  by  coming together and creating a social contract in which a group of people agree to have  one  supreme  authority  rule  over  a  commonwealth.  Within  the  social contract, fear serves two purposes: 1. It creates the state of war within the state of nature so that a social contract is required. 2. It upholds the peace within a commonwealth (by allowing for the supreme authority to instill fear in everyone through punishing those who break the contract).']...\n",

However,  as  his  investigations  in  logic  became more  in-depth,  Frege  realized  that,  to  continue  pursuing  his  work,  he  first needed  to  understand  language.  By  doing  so,  he  created  some  of  the  most groundbreaking work in the philosophy of language. Frege  questions  identity,  names,  and  the  expression  a  =  b.  For  example, Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens. However, if a = b is informative, how come a = a is trivial and doesn’t actually provide any new information? Frege  believed  that  it  is  not  simply  the  objects  that  are  relevant  to  the meaning  of  a  sentence,  but  how  the  objects  are  presented.  Words  refer  to things  in  the  external  world—however,  names  hold  more  meaning  than simply  being  references  to  objects.  Frege  broke  sentences  and  expressions up  into  two  parts:  the  sense  and  the  reference  (or  meaning).  To  Frege,  the sense  of  a  sentence  is  the  objective,  universal,  and  abstract  thought  the sentence  is  expressing  and  the  “mode  of  presentation”  of  the  object  that  is being  referred to.  The reference, or meaning,  of a sentence is  the  object  in the  real  world  that  the  sentence  is  referring  to.  The  reference  represents  a truth-value (whether something is true or false) and is determined by senses. Frege expresses this theory as a triangle: The intersection of line a and line b is the same as the intersection of line b  and  line  c.  Therefore,  this  statement  is  informative  because  we  are presented with  two  different modes  of presentation.  To say the  intersection of line a and line b is the same as the intersection of line a and line b only presents one single mode of presentation, and is therefore trivial. Frege concludes that there are three parts to a name (though all three are not necessarily needed in every case): 1. Sign: The word or words used (for example, Mark Twain). 2. Sense: The way to get at what is being referred to by the sign (for example, the psychological implications we have of Mark Twain—he is a humorist; he is the author of Tom Sawyer; etc.). 3. Referent: The actual object being referred to (for example, Mark Twain is also Samuel Clemens, who is also the author of Tom Sawyer).']...\n",

Intentionality  is  defined  as  the  particular  mental  states  that  are directed  toward  objects  or  things  in  the  real  world.  Intentionality  is  not about one’s intention to do something or not do something, but rather, the ability of our thoughts to be about something. For example, you can have a belief  about  roller  coasters,  but  a  roller  coaster  itself  cannot  be  about anything.  Therefore,  mental  states  like  fear,  hope,  and  desire  have  to  be intentional because there must be an object that is being referenced. Nineteenth-century German philosopher Franz Brentano argued that only mental  phenomena  could  show  intentionality.  Later,  twentieth-century philosopher  John  Searle  questioned  how  the  mind  and  language  has  the ability  to  force  intentionality  onto  objects  when  such  objects  are  not intentional on their own. In his theory of speech acts, Searle concludes that actions  have  intentionality  as  well,  because  language  is  a  form  of  human behavior and an action on its own. Therefore, by saying something, one is actually performing an action, and intentionality is present in actions. In a much-debated discussion on artificial intelligence, Searle argued that machines  would  never  have  the  ability  to  think.  Searle  claimed  that machines lack intentionality and that only an organized mind, like that of a human being, is able to perform intentionality.']...\n",

The root of every thought a person ever has is the notion that he is aware of something, which is proof that something must exist. Therefore, if something must exist, that must mean that existence has to exist. Existence is necessary and required for there to be any type of knowledge. When one denies the existence of something, he is saying that something does not exist. However, even the very act of denying can only be possible if  existence  exists.  In order  for  anything to  exist,  it must have an identity. Everything  that  exists  exists  as  something,  for  otherwise  it  would  be nothing and would not exist. In order for one to have a thought of being aware of something, one has to be conscious. Therefore, according to René Descartes, consciousness has to exist because one cannot deny the existence of his mind while using his mind  to  make  that  denial.  However,  Descartes’s  axiom  was  incorrect because he believed a person has the ability to be aware without there being something to be aware of. This cannot be the case, however. Consciousness,  rather,  is  the  faculty  to  perceive  what  exists.  Being conscious means one is perceiving something, so to function, consciousness requires that there be something outside of itself. Therefore, consciousness not only requires existence; it is also dependent upon existence. Descartes’s axiom  of  consciousness  as  being  aware  of  being  conscious  cannot, therefore,  be  the  case  because  to  be  conscious  requires  the  existence  of something external.']...\n",

As  Aristotle states  in  his  law  of  identity,  in  order  to  exist,  an  entity  must  have  a particular identity. In  discussing  what  the  identity  of  an  entity  is,  two  very  important concepts arise: change and causality. Many identities can appear to be unstable. Houses can fall apart; eggs can break; plants can die; etc. However, these identities are not unstable; these objects  are  simply  being  affected  by  causality  and  are  changing  based  on their  identities.  Therefore,  identity  needs  to  be  explained  based  on  the entity’s  building  blocks  and  how  those  interact  with  one  another.  In  other words, the identity of an entity is the sum of its parts. One can describe a house  by  describing  how  the  different  parts  of  wood,  glass,  and  metal interact  with  one  another  in  a  specific  way  to  form  the  house,  or  one  can define a house’s identity based on its formation of atoms. To alter an identity, a change (caused by an action) needs to occur. The law  of  causality  states  that  all  causes  have  specific  effects  that  are dependent on the original identities of the entities. Currently, three main theories discuss the issue of change: 1. Perdurantism: This is the notion that objects are four-dimensional. According to perdurantism, objects have temporal parts (parts that exist in time), and at every moment of existence, objects only partly exist. So for example, there would be a series of stages for the life of a tree. 2. Endurantism: This is the notion that objects are the same and whole throughout every moment of the objects’ history. So for example, as a tree loses leaves, it is still considered to be the same tree. 3. Mereological Essentialism: This notion explains that parts of an object are essential to that object. Therefore, the object is not able to persist if any of its parts change. According to mereological essentialism, when a tree loses its leaves, it is no longer the same tree. Because metaphysics touches on our existence and what it truly means to be in the world, it touches on a wide variety of philosophical issues. And it is for this very reason that metaphysics is often considered to be the foundation of philosophy, or “first philosophy.”']...\n",

      "Content: ['Jean-Paul Sartre was born on June 21, 1905, in Paris, France. When Sartre’s father  died  in  1906,  Sartre  and  his  mother  moved  in  with  his  mother’s father,  Karl  Schweitzer,  who  was  a  respected  philosophical  and  religious writer. His grandfather’s religious beliefs proved to be a point of contention for  Sartre  growing  up,  and  though  he  resented  his  grandfather’s  presence, he was open to being tutored by Schweitzer. Sartre  studied  philosophy  at  the  prestigious  university  École  Normale Supérieure  in  1924,  and  in  1928,  he  met  fellow  classmate  and  lifelong companion Simone de Beauvoir (who would go on to write The Second Sex, which  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  feminist  texts  ever produced).  Upon  graduating,  Sartre  enlisted  in  the  army  and  then  took  a teaching  job  in  France.  By  1933,  Sartre  had  moved  to  Berlin  to  study philosophy  with  Edmund  Husserl,  and  while  in  Berlin,  he  also  became acquainted with Martin Heidegger. The work of these two men would have a  profound  impact  on  Sartre’s  own  philosophy,  and  in  1938,  Sartre’s philosophical novel, Nausea, was published. In  1939,  at  the  beginning  of  World  War  II,  Sartre  was  drafted  into  the French army. In 1940, Sartre was captured by the Germans and was held as a prisoner of war for nine months. During this time, Sartre began to write his most famous existential work, Being and Nothingness. Sartre returned to Paris  in  1941,  and  two  years  later,  Being  and Nothingness  was  published, propelling  Sartre’s  fame  in  the  public  eye  and  establishing  him  as  a  key intellectual of the post-war era. Sartre then served as editor for the journal Les Temps  Modernes,  where he was able to continually write and hone his philosophy, focusing on the political  and  social  world  of  the  time  and  becoming  a  political  activist. Sartre  remained  committed  to  political  activism  for  the  rest  of  his  life.  A staunch  Socialist,  Sartre  supported  the  Soviet  Union  during  the  Cold  War (even  though  he  was  critical  of  the  totalitarianism  that  was  featured  in Sovietism), met with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in support of Marxism, opposed  the  Vietnam  War,  and  was  famously  an  outspoken  critic  of France’s colonization of Algeria. Sartre was a prolific writer. In 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature,  which he declined  (making  him the  first  person  to  ever  do so), claiming  that  no  writer  should  be  turned  into  an  institution  and  that  the cultures  of  the  East  and  West  must  be  able  to  exchange  with  one  another without the help of an institution. Throughout his extensive writing career, he wrote philosophical books, films, and plays.']...\n",

If a person believes that his place in society determines  his  sense  of  self  or  that  his  views  cannot  be  changed,  he  is deceiving  himself.  Telling  someone  “that’s  just  how  I  am”  is  also  self- deception. According to Sartre, self-actualization, the process of making something from what someone has already been made into, is always possible. To do so, one must recognize what Sartre calls the “facticity”—the realities (based on  facts)  that  occur  outside  of  the  individual  that  are  acting  on  him.  One must also understand that he has a consciousness that exists independently from those realities.

      "Content: ['Those  who  believe  in  compatibilism  (also  known  as  soft  determinism) believe that humans do have free will—however, this free will is viewed as being  compatible  with  determinism  (which  is  causal,  and  as  a  philosophy states that nothing is by chance; everything that happens is the result of what happened  before,  and  everything  about  you  and  everything  that  you  do  is inevitable). According  to  compatibilism,  humans  can  be  free  agents  (and  have  free will)  when  they  are  free  of  certain  constraints.  According  to  both determinism  and  compatibilism,  peoples’  personalities  and  characteristics are  determined  in  ways  that  are  out  of  their  hands  (genetics,  upbringing, etc.). However, in compatibilism, the existence of these constraints does not mean  one  cannot  also  have  free  will,  because  compatibilism  works  off  of those things that are determined. The definition of free will in compatibilism is that one is free to choose how to act to whatever extent made possible by that person’s makeup. But  then,  if  it  is  not  determinism  that  is  considered  to  be  a  constraint  in compatibilism,  what  is  the  constraint?  According  to  compatibilism,  a constraint is any type of external coercion. Free will, therefore, is defined as freedom  of  action.  As  long  as  an  individual  is  able  to  make  his  own decisions (even if those decisions are already determined) free of an external force (like imprisonment), then that person has free will. Alternatively,  some  people  do  not  believe  in  compatibilism.  Those  who believe  incompatibilism  to  be  true  claim  that  determinism  is  simply incompatible  with  the  notion  of  free  will.  For  example,  how  can  one  have free will if every decision is predetermined from birth? This does not necessarily mean that incompatibilism states free will does or  does  not  exist.  In  fact,  incompatibilism  can  be  broken  down  into  three types: 1. Hard determinism (which denies the existence of free will) 2. Metaphysical libertarianism (which states free will does exist and denies the existence of compatibilism) 3. Pessimistic incompatibilism (which states that neither free will nor compatibilism is true) The  previous  image  shows  several  offshoots  of  compatibilism  and incompatibilism: Semicompatibilism is the notion that determinism is compatible with moral responsibility. Hard incompatibilism is the belief that moral responsibility and free will are not compatible with determinism. Illusionism is the belief that free will is just an illusion. Incompatibilists  who  deny  determinism  accept  that  random  events  must therefore occur in the world (be they mental, biological, physical, etc.), and thus,  randomness  and  accidents  do  exist.  This  then  creates  chains  of unpredictable  futures  (as  opposed  to  the  one  predestined  future  in determinism). Another  form  of  incompatibilism,  metaphysical  libertarianism,  comes  in four different branches of causality: This image shows the following options: Event-causal libertarianism is the notion that some events are not as predictable from earlier events and are uncaused. Soft causality is the belief that most events are determined, while some events are not as predictable. Agent-causal libertarianism is the belief that new causal chains can begin that are not determined by past events or laws of nature. Non-causal libertarianism is the idea that in order to make decisions, no cause is needed at all. Those who believe in compatibilism believe humans can be free agents (and have free will) when they are free of certain constraints, and that personalities and characteristics are determined in ways that are out of their hands (such as genetics or upbringing), while incompatibilists deny that determinism plays a role in free will and accept that random events and accidents must therefore occur in the world (be they mental, biological, physical, etc.).']...\n",

      "Header: RESPONSIBILITY\n",
      "Content: ['When discussing free will, one must also discuss the idea of responsibility; particularly the distinction between responsibility and moral responsibility. Responsibility  is  when  one  takes  on  a  task  or  burden  and  accepts  the associated consequences. For example, if you take on the responsibility of organizing  a  conference  for  work,  then  you  not  only  take  on  the  task  of organizing  the  event,  but  you  are  also  taking  on  the  responsibility  of  its outcome;  be  it  a  success  or  failure.  This  is  responsibility.  Moral responsibility,  on  the  other  hand,  is  responsibility  based  on  one’s  moral codes. Let’s say that on the day of the conference, a big snowstorm hits and none of the speakers can make the conference. You are responsible for the success or failure of the conference, but are you morally responsible for the conference’s failure? It seems that humans do in fact feel responsible for their actions. But why is  this  the  case?  If  one’s  actions  are  determined  by  events,  that  is  to  say, one’s  actions  are  the  result  of  events  and  have  been  planned  since  before birth,  then  libertarians  would  ask  why  people  feel  responsible  for  their actions.  Similarly,  if  one’s  actions  are  totally  random  and  determined entirely by chance, determinists would wonder why people feel responsible for  their  actions.  Together,  these  questions  create  the  standard  argument against free will. Yet  humans  do  feel  responsible  for  their  actions.  So  if  a  person  is responsible for his actions, this must mean that responsibility is caused by something that is within all of us. Therefore, a prerequisite of responsibility is free will, and not the other way around. And furthermore, a prerequisite of moral responsibility is responsibility, and not the other way around. One does not need moral responsibility to have responsibility, but one certainly needs responsibility to have moral responsibility.']...\n",

Plato  called  laughter  malicious,  and  described enjoying  comedy  as  being  a  type  of  scorn.  In  Plato’s  ideal  state,  humor would  be  under  tight  control;  the  Guardian  class  would  have  to  avoid laughing; and no “composer of comedy” would be allowed to make citizens laugh. Plato’s  objections  to  humor  and  laughter  carried  over  to  Christian thinkers and, later, to European philosophers. In the Bible, laughter is often referred  to  as  a  source  of  hostility,  and  in  monasteries,  laughter  was condemned.

This  philosophical  theory  was  the  dominant  one  until  the  eighteenth century, when philosopher Francis Hutcheson critiqued the ideas of Thomas Hobbes. Hutcheson claimed that feeling superior is neither a sufficient nor a necessary explanation of laughter and that there are cases when one laughs in  which  feelings  of  glory  or  self-comparison  are  simply  not  present.  For example, one can laugh at a figure of speech that seems odd. In other cases of humor, we see the points Hutcheson was making. When we  watch  Charlie  Chaplin,  we  laugh  at  the  incredibly  clever  stunts  he performed.  Laughing  at  these  stunts  does  not  require  one  to  compare himself  to  Chaplin,  and  even  if  one  does  compare  himself,  he  does  not laugh because he believes himself to be superior. People  also  have  the  ability  to  laugh  at  themselves  without  laughing  at their  former  selves,  which  the  superiority  theory  cannot  explain.  If  one searches for his glasses only to discover that he has been wearing them the whole time, this is reason to laugh.

      "Content: ['One  theory  that came  about  during  the  eighteenth century that weakens the superiority theory is known as the relief theory. The relief theory claims laughter  behaves  in  the  nervous  system  the  way  a  pressure-relief  valve works in a steam boiler. The relief theory first appears in 1709 in Lord Shaftesbury’s An Essay on the  Freedom  and  Wit  of  Humor,  and  it  is  notable  for  being  the  very  first time humor is discussed as being a sense of funniness. During  this  time  period,  scientists  understood  that  the  brain  has  nerves that  connect  it  to  muscles  and  sense  organs.  However,  scientists  also believed  nerves  carried  liquids  and  gases,  like  blood  and  air,  which  they referred  to  as  “animal  spirits.”  In  An  Essay  on  the  Freedom  and  Wit  of Humor,  Shaftesbury  claims  these  animal  spirits  build  pressure  within  the nerves, and that laughter is responsible for releasing the animal spirits. As  science  advanced  and  the  biology  of  the  nervous  system  became clearer,  the  relief  theory  adapted.  According  to  philosopher  Herbert Spencer, emotions actually take on a physical form within the body, and this is known as nervous energy. Spencer claimed that nervous energy leads to muscular motion. For example, the nervous energy from anger creates small movements (like clenching your fist), and as the anger increases, so too do the  muscle  movements  (like  throwing  a  punch).  Thus,  the  nervous  energy builds up and is then released. According  to  Spencer,  laughter  also  releases  nervous  energy.  However, Spencer  identifies  one  major  difference  between  the  release  of  nervous energy from laughter versus other emotions: The muscle movements caused by laughter are not the beginning stages of larger actions. Laughter, unlike emotions,  does  not  revolve  around  having  a  motivation  to  do  something. The  bodily  movements  associated  with  laughter  are  simply  a  release  of pent-up nervous energy. Spencer  then  goes  on  to  claim  that  the  nervous  energy  that  laughter releases  is  the  energy  of  inappropriate  emotions.  For  example,  if  you  are reading a story that starts off by causing anger but then ends in a joke, the anger from the beginning needs to be re-evaluated. So that nervous energy, which is no longer applicable, is then released in the form of laughter. Perhaps the most famous version of the relief theory is Sigmund Freud’s. He looked at three different types of situations that would result in laughter being the release of nervous energy from a psychological activity: “joking,” “the  comic,”  and  “humor.”  According  to  Freud,  in  joking  (the  telling  of jokes  and  funny  banter),  the  unnecessary  energy  represses  feelings;  in  the comic  (for  example,  laughing  at  a  clown),  the  unnecessary  energy  is  that energy  devoted  to  thinking  (a  large  amount  of  energy  is  required  to understand  the  clumsy  movements  of  the  clown,  while  a  small  amount  of energy  is  required  for  us  to  perform  our  own  movements  smoothly,  thus creating a surplus of energy); and in humor, the release of energy is similar to the release described by Herbert Spencer (an emotion becomes prepared, then is never utilized and needs to be laughed off).']...\n",

According  to  this theory,  laughter  is  caused  by  the  perception  of  something  that  is incongruous, meaning it violates our expectations and our mental patterns. This is currently the dominant theory explaining humor; it has been backed by influential philosophers and psychologists, including Søren Kierkegaard, Immanuel  Kant,  and  Arthur  Schopenhauer  (it  was  even  hinted  at  by Aristotle). James  Beattie,  the  first  philosopher  to  use  the  term  incongruous  when referencing the philosophy of humor, claimed that laughter is caused by the mind taking notice of two or more incongruous circumstances that unite in one  complex  assemblage.  Kant,  who  never  used  the  term  incongruous, examined  how  jokes  toy  with  one’s  expectations.  To  Kant,  jokes  (for example, a setup followed by a punch line) evoke, shift, and then dissipate one’s  thoughts.  Kant  notes  that  the  thrust  of  ideas  then  creates  a  physical thrust  of  one’s  internal  organs,  and  this  is,  in  turn,  an  enjoyable  physical stimulation. Following  Kant’s  work,  Arthur  Schopenhauer’s  version  of the incongruity  theory  claimed  that  the  sources  of  humor  are  the  abstract rational  knowledge  we  have  of  something  and  the  sense  perceptions  of those  things.  Schopenhauer  claimed  humor  is  the  result  of  suddenly realizing  the  incongruity  between  a  concept  of  something  and  the perception of something that should be the same. As the theory of incongruity developed throughout the twentieth century, a flaw of older versions was discovered—the implication that, with regard to  humor,  the  perception  of  incongruity  is  sufficient.  This  cannot  be, because  instead  of  amusement,  one  could  theoretically  experience  anger, disgust, or fear, for example. Therefore, humorous amusement is not simply responding to incongruity; it is enjoying it.']...\n",

Belief systems and teachings were based on the  work  of  the  ancient  Greeks,  and  these  philosophies  had  been incorporated into the doctrine of the Catholic Church. When the Renaissance occurred,  there  was  suddenly  a  renewed  interest  in  the  natural  world.  As people  discovered  their  findings  did  not  match  the  doctrine  of  the  church (which had, up until that point, been accepted as true), more people began to investigate the world around them, and scientific discoveries relating to the natural world flourished. This scientific exploration reached its apex during the 1500s and 1600s, in what  is  known  as  the  scientific  revolution.  Advancements  in  science  and mathematics from Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton, and Galileo Galilei not only questioned the work of Aristotle and the church; they  made  people  view  nature  and  humanity  in  completely  different  ways. The introduction of the scientific method, which is based on observation and experimentation,  allowed  scientists  to  explain  various  theories  through  the use of reason and logic, and removed tradition from science.']...\n",

While philosophers of this time did not see reason as its own source of knowledge, they explored human cognitive faculties (the abilities of the human mind) in new ways. Perhaps the most influential empiricist to come out of this time period was John Locke, whose most important theory was that the mind is a tabula rasa, or blank slate, at birth and that only when one has experiences does one begin to form knowledge. The  other  major  empiricist  to  come  out  of  the  Enlightenment  was  Sir Isaac  Newton,  who  would  go  on  to  completely  revolutionize  science  and mathematics  (including  creating  calculus  and  identifying  the  existence  of gravity).

The  work  of  René  Descartes, who  attempted  to  find  fundamental  truths  by  assuming  propositions  to  be false  and  by  casting  doubt  on  the  senses,  was  particularly  influential.  Not only did Descartes question the ideas of Aristotle; he radically changed how one could view knowledge, which made way for new forms of science. Through  Cartesian  philosophy  (the  term  for  René  Descartes’s  views), various controversial questions arose from the intellectual community: Are the body and mind two substances that are separate and distinct from one another? How are the two related (with regard to both the human body and the unified world)? What role does God play in cementing our knowledge? It  is  from  the  various  questions  posed  by  Cartesian  philosophy  that Baruch Spinoza, one of the Enlightenment’s most influential philosophers, emerged. Baruch  Spinoza  tackled  the  Cartesian  theory  of  dualism  and  developed the theory of ontological monism (the notion that there is only one kind of substance, be it God or nature, that has two attributes that correspond to the mind and body). By identifying God with nature and denying the existence of a supreme being, Baruch Spinoza lays the foundation of the naturalism and  atheism  that  can  be  seen  throughout  the  philosophies  of  the Enlightenment. In  addition  to  Descartes  and  Spinoza,  there  were  several  other  key philosophers of the Enlightenment that focused on rationalism. In Germany, one  of  the  most  influential  philosophers  was  Gottfried  Wilhelm  Leibniz, who emphasized the principle of sufficient reason—the idea that there must be  a  sufficient  reason  for  the  existence  of  everything  that  exists.  The principle  of  sufficient  reason  plays into the  very ideals  of the Enlightenment,  as  it  presents  the  universe  as  being  completely  intelligible through the use of reason. Based on Leibniz’s work, Christian Wolff set out to answer the question of how the principle of sufficient reason could be grounded through the use of logic and the use of the principle of noncontradiction (which posits that a statement can never be true and false at the exact same time). Wolff did so by creating a rationalist system of knowledge, with the goal of showing that first principles, known as a priori, could demonstrate the truths of science. What  makes  the  work  of  Wolff  quintessential  to  the  Enlightenment movement is not that he attempted to use reason to prove his argument; it’s that he attempted to prove his argument using human reason.']...\n",

This perfection  then  leads  to  harmony  and  order.  When  one  deems  something beautiful  (through  feelings  of  pleasure),  one  is  sensing  some  sort  of perfection or harmony.

Through  empiricism  and  subjectivism, the  understanding  of  aesthetics  shifted  to  the  viewer’s  understanding  of beauty,  in  which  both  the  experience  of  and  the  response  to  beauty  were examined. One of the major figures of this time, Lord Shaftesbury, agreed with the classic principle that beauty is truth. However, Shaftesbury did not believe this  truth  to  be  an  objective  rational  order  that  one  has  the  ability  of knowing. To Shaftesbury, the response to aesthetics is that of a disinterested unegoistic pleasure, meaning it is independent of one’s thoughts on how to promote  his  own  self-interest  (this  revelation  would  pave  the  way  for  his theory on ethics based on the same idea). He claimed that beauty is a type of  harmony  that  is  free  from  the  human  mind,  and  that  our  immediate understanding of beauty is a form of participation with this harmony. Shaftesbury  then  shifted  his  focus  to  the  nature  of  one’s  response  to beauty,  and  believed  that  this  response  elevated  one  morally,  above  self- interest. By shifting away from what makes something beautiful and toward the behavior of human nature with regard to beauty, Shaftesbury connected aesthetics  with  beauty,  morality,  and  ethics  and  furthered  the  interest  in human nature that had become associated with the Enlightenment. As  the  Enlightenment  progressed,  later  philosophers  such  as  Immanuel Kant and David Hume contributed immensely to notions of empiricism and subjectivity, specifically with regard to the role of imagination.']...\n",

      "Content: ['The  Enlightenment  is  perhaps  most  significant  for  its  accomplishments  in politics.  During  this  time,  three  distinct  revolutions  occurred:  the  English Revolution,  the  American  Revolution,  and  the  French  Revolution.  As philosophers  during  the  Enlightenment  began  to  shift  toward  thoughts regarding human nature and became critical of established truths from the church and monarchy, the sociopolitical atmosphere also fell under scrutiny. Sympathizers  of  these  revolutions  believed  that  the  political  and  social authority  was  based  on  obscure  traditions  and  religious  myths,  and  they began to spread ideas of freedom, equality, human rights, and the need for a legitimate  political  system.  Philosophers  came  to  not  only  criticize government; they also created theories on what government should be like. It  is  here  that  we  see  people  start  to  embrace  ideas  such  as  the  right  to religious  freedom  and  the  need  for  a  political  system  with  checks  and balances. During this time, the political works of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes were the most influential. As outlooks on politics and society began to change, so too did the way people viewed ethics and religion. With the increase of industrialization and urbanization,  as  well  as  the  bloody  wars  fought  in  the  name  of  religion, people  (and  certainly  philosophers)  began  to  question  the  motivations behind  happiness,  morality,  and  religion.  Instead  of  finding  happiness  by uniting  with  God  or  determining  what  makes  something  good  based  on what  one’s  religion  tells  him,  philosophers  began  to  turn  toward  human nature and asked questions like: What would make one happy in this life? Philosophers  of  the  Enlightenment  called  for  religion  to  rid  itself  of superstition,  supernaturalism,  and  fanaticism  and  advocated  for  a  more rational  form.  Anger  toward  the  Catholic  Church  grew,  and  Protestantism began  to  grow  in  popularity.  Religion  during  the  Enlightenment  began  to take on four types: 1. Atheism: The idea, as stated by Denis Diderot, that humans should look not toward a supernatural being to discover the principles of natural order, but rather, within their own natural processes. Atheism was more common in France than in any other location during the Enlightenment. 2. Deism: This is the belief that there is a supreme being that created and governs the universe and has always had a plan for creation since its inception; however, this supreme being will not interfere with creation. Deism is most commonly thought of as the religion associated with the Enlightenment. Deism rejects the idea of miracles or special revelations, and instead argues that natural light is the true proof that there is a supreme being. Deists rejected the divinity of Jesus Christ, instead claiming him to be more like an excellent moral teacher. Deism also allowed for new discoveries in natural science, believing that God created this order. 3. Religion of the Heart: This is the belief that the God associated with deism is too rationalistic and distant from the constant struggles of humanity (and therefore, not serving the purpose religion is supposed to serve). Religion of the heart, notably embraced by philosophers Rousseau and Shaftesbury, is a religion based on human sentiments. While sometimes considered to be a form of deism, religion of the heart is a “natural” religion, notable for its lack of “artificial forms of worship” and metaphysical grounding. Instead, emphasis is placed on natural human emotions. 4. Fideism: One of the single most important works to come out of the Enlightenment was David Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. In Dialogues, which was published in 1779 after Hume’s death, Hume (an atheist) criticizes the supposition that the world must have been created and authored by a supreme being because human existence and reason exist. Fideism states that no matter what, rational criticism cannot get rid of religious belief because religious belief is so “natural.” Essentially, according to fideism, one does not need reasons to have religious belief; all one needs is faith. Some forms of fideism even go so far as to say that religious beliefs can be legitimate even if those beliefs oppose or conflict with reason. Through its rejection of the traditional, pre-established thought of the ancient Greeks and its emphasis on human knowledge and reason, the Enlightenment completely revolutionized the ways in which people viewed philosophy, science, politics, and society as a whole, and forever changed the shape of Western philosophy.']...\n",

Six  months  after  his  father’s  passing,  Nietzsche’s  two-year-old brother died, leaving Nietzsche with his mother and two sisters. Nietzsche later said that the passing of his father and brother had a profound impact on him. From the age of fourteen to nineteen, Friedrich Nietzsche attended one of the best boarding schools in Germany, and as he continued his education at the University of Bonn and the University of Leipzig, he gravitated toward philology  (an  academic  discipline  that  revolved  around  the  interpretations of biblical and classical texts). During this time, Nietzsche, who had been composing music since he was a teenager, became acquainted with famous composer  Richard  Wagner  (who  also  happened  to  be  an  idol  of Nietzsche’s),  and  the  close  friendship  that  resulted  between  the  two  men would prove to have an incredible impact on Nietzsche throughout his life (twenty  years  later,  Nietzsche  would  recall  their  friendship  as  being  the “greatest  achievement”  of  his  life).  By  the  time  he  was  twenty-four  years old,  having  not  even  completed  his  doctorate,  Nietzsche  was  offered  a faculty position at the University of Basel department of philology. After a brief stint serving as a medical orderly in 1870 during the Franco- Prussian  War  (where  he  contracted  dysentery,  syphilis,  and  diphtheria), Nietzsche  returned  to  the  University  of  Basel,  and  in  1872,  Nietzsche published his first book, The Birth of Tragedy. The book, while praised by Wagner,  was  met  with  negative  criticism,  particularly  by  Ulrich  von Wilamowitz-Möllendorff,  who  would  go  on  to  become  one  of  the  leading German philologists of the time. Nietzsche remained at the University of Basel until 1879. By 1878, it had become  clear  that  Nietzsche  was  more  interested  in  philosophy  than philology,  and  his  book  Human,  All-Too-Human  marks  the  shift  in  his philosophical style (and the end of his friendship with Wagner, whose anti- Semitism  and  German  nationalism  disgusted  Nietzsche).  At  the  age  of thirty-four,  Nietzsche’s  health  had  deteriorated  so  much  that  he  had  to resign from the university. From  1878  to  1889,  as  his  health  severely  declined,  Nietzsche  moved around between German, Swiss, and Italian cities and wrote eleven books. On  January  3,  1889,  Nietzsche  suffered  from  a  nervous  breakdown (possibly as a result of syphilis) when he watched a man whip a horse on the  street.  Nietzsche  collapsed  on  the  street  and  never  regained  his  sanity. He would spend the next eleven years in a vegetative state until his death on August 25, 1900.']...\n",

Nietzsche, on the other hand, viewed these as troubling times marked by a fundamental crisis in values. In his book, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche tells the story of a man named  Zarathustra  who,  at  the  age  of  thirty,  goes  into  the  wilderness  and enjoys  it  so  much,  he  decides  to  live  there  for  the  next  ten  years.  Upon returning  to  society,  he  declares  God  to  be  dead.  From  Thus  Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche argued that the advancements of science made it so that people no longer turned to the prominent sets of values brought about by  Christianity,  and  that  there  was  no  longer  that  powerful  grasp  on civilization,  brought  about  by  Christianity,  that  determines  what  makes something good and what makes something evil. While  he  was  actually  a  critic  of  Christianity,  Nietzsche  was  an  even larger  critic  of  atheism,  and  feared  it  would  be  the  next  logical  step. Nietzsche  did  not  claim  that  science  introduces  a  new  set  of  values  to people  that  replaces  those  values  set  forth  by  Christianity.  Instead,  he claimed that it is nihilism, the abandonment of any and all beliefs, that will come to replace the moral code set forth by Christianity. Nietzsche  believed  that  there  is  always  a  need  for  people  to  identify  a source of value and meaning, and he concluded that if science was not that source,  it  would  appear  in  other  ways,  such  as  aggressive  nationalism. Nietzsche  did  not  argue  that  there  is  a  need  to  return  to  the  traditions  of Christianity.

      "Content: ['Nietzsche’s theory of the will to power can be broken up into two parts. First, Nietzsche believed that everything in this world is in flux, and that a fixed being simply does not exist. Matter, knowledge, truth, and so on, is always changing, and the very core of this change is something known as the  “will  to  power.”  The  universe,  according  to  Nietzsche,  is  made  up  of wills. Second, the will to power is an individual’s fundamental drive for power, which  comes  about  through  dominance  and  independence.  The  will  to power is much stronger than the will to sex or the will to survive, and it can appear in different ways. While the will to power, according to Nietzsche, could  appear  as  violence  or  physical  dominance,  it  could  also  be  turned inward and make one pursue mastery of his own self (as opposed to mastery of someone else). Nietzsche  believed  that  the  notion  of  the  ego  or  soul  is  simply  a grammatical fiction. To Nietzsche, “I” is actually a mix of competing wills that constantly and chaotically try to overcome each other. Since the world is in flux and change is the most fundamental part of life, any attempts at viewing  life  as  objective  and  fixed,  whether  in  regard  to  philosophy, science, or religion, are viewed as life-denying. Therefore, in order to live based on a life-affirming philosophy, one must embrace change and understand that change is the only constant.']...\n",

Our  will  to  power  shifted  from outward (controlling others) to inward (self-mastery); however, this process of self-mastery is difficult, and there is a constant temptation for humanity to  give  up  (two  such  examples  of  humanity  giving  up,  according  to Nietzsche, are nihilism and Christian morality). In attempting to gain self- mastery, humans are on their way to becoming the overman, an entity that possesses  self-mastery  (which  is  lacking  in  animals)  and  good  conscience (which  is  lacking  in  humans).  The  overman  has  a  deep  love  of  life  and willingly  accepts  the  constant  struggle  and  suffering  without  ever complaining.

While belief is necessary for knowledge to exist, it is not all that is needed; there needs to be something else that allows for one’s thoughts to match up with the real world. When thoughts do not match with the real world, then they cannot be considered knowledge. For example, one cannot know a bridge is safe to cross without first crossing it safely. If you believe the bridge is safe to cross, but as you begin to cross it, it collapses, then you cannot say that you knew it was safe. One can believe the bridge is safe to cross, and then only after safely crossing it can one then declare  that  they  know  it  is  safe.  In  the  process  of  acquiring  knowledge, people  attempt  to  increase  the  amount  of  true  beliefs  they  have  (and minimize the amount of false beliefs in the process). Therefore,  for  a  belief  to  be  deemed  knowledge,  it  must  be  true.  Truth, then,  is  considered to  be a condition  of knowledge—if truth  did  not  exist, then neither would knowledge. Even in situations where truth does exist, if there is no truth within a specific domain, then there is no knowledge in that specific  domain.  For  example,  if  it  is  true  that  beauty  is  in  the  eye  of  the beholder,  then  determining  whether  something  is  beautiful  cannot  be considered knowledge because that belief cannot be true or false.

A  classic depiction of eternal recurrence from the Renaissance era is the Ouroboros, a dragon or snake eating its own tail. One part of Nietzsche’s theory of eternal recurrence is the notion that time is  cyclical,  meaning  people  will  live  each  moment  of  their  entire  life  over and over an endless amount of times, and each time will be the same.

The second part of Nietzsche’s theory of eternal recurrence is that “being” does  not  exist  because  everything  is  constantly  changing—therefore, everything  is  constantly  “becoming.”  Nietzsche  asserts  that  reality  is intertwined and that we cannot distinguish “things” from other “things” due to  the  fact  that  everything  is  constantly  changing.  Therefore,  one  cannot judge one part of reality without judging all of reality. By coming to terms with the fact that our lives are in a constant state of becoming, we can either say “yes” or “no” to all of life. Considered to be one of the first existentialist philosophers,  Friedrich  Nietzsche  had  an  influence  on  philosophy  that  was truly  incredible.  Above  all  else,  Nietzsche’s  emphasis  of  “life-affirmation” and  his  challenges  to  morality  and  Christianity  made  him  one  of  the  most important philosophers of his time.']...\n",

      "Content: ['The  sorites  paradox  is  another  famous  paradox  created  by  Eubulides  of Miletus.  This  paradox  tackles  the  idea  of  vagueness.  The  word  sorites comes  from  the  Greek  word  soros,  which  means  “heap.”  The  sorites paradox states: Imagine you have a heap of sand. While a single grain of sand does not make  a  heap,  many  grains,  like  1,000,000  grains,  for  example,  do  make  a heap. 1. If you were to remove a single grain of sand from the 1,000,000 grains of sand, then you would still have a heap. 2. If you were to remove another grain of sand, then you would still have a heap. 3. If you were to remove another grain of sand, then you would still have a heap. Eventually, you can remove enough grains of sand so that it is no longer considered a heap, but at what point is that the case? Is 500 grains of sand still considered a heap but 499 grains of sand not? The sorites paradox is also seen in another paradox created by Eubulides: the Bald Man. This paradox states: 1. If a man has one hair on his head, then he is considered bald. 2. If a man that has one hair on his head is considered bald, then a man with two hairs on his head is considered bald. 3. If a man that has two hairs on his head is considered bald, then a man with three hairs on his head is considered bald. Therefore, a man with 1,000,000 hairs on his head is considered bald. Even  though  a  man  with  1,000,000  hairs  would  certainly  not  be considered bald, according to logic, he should be considered as such. So at what point is the man no longer considered bald? Philosophers  Gottlob  Frege  and  Bertrand  Russell  argued  that  ideal language  should  have  precision  and  that  natural  language  has  a  defect, vagueness. By getting rid of vagueness, one would eliminate soritical terms, thus getting rid of the sorites paradox. Later,  American  philosopher  Willard  van  Orman  Quine  believed vagueness  could  be  eliminated  from  natural  language  entirely.  While  this would affect ordinary ways in which people talk, the “sweet simplicity,” as Quine describes it, would be worth it.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Denying some of the premises of the sorites paradox is the most common solution today. In these solutions, logic can be applied to natural language; however,  there  are  issues  regarding  the  premises  on  which  the  sorites paradox is based. The Epistemic Theory In the epistemic theory, one conditional is assumed to be false and there is a certain cutoff point in any sorites paradox where the predicate no longer applies (and instead, the negation applies). If we were to again use the Bald Man paradox as an example: 1. A man that has one hair on his head is considered bald. 2. If a man that has one hair on his head is considered bald, then a man that has two hairs on his head is considered bald. 3. If a man that has two hairs on his head is considered bald, then a man that has three hairs on his head is considered bald. Therefore, a man that has 1,000,000 hairs on his head is considered bald. Imagine  now  that  we  reject  one  of  the  other  premises  besides  the  first premise. For example, let’s imagine the cutoff point to be at 130 hairs. This means that anyone with 129 hairs on his head would be bald, while anyone with 130 hairs on his head would not be bald. Naturally,  many  find  the  epistemic  theory  to  be  questionable.  If  one  of the  premises  is  false,  how  would  anyone  know  which  premise  it  is? Additionally, how would one find out this information? If we use the word bald, that word has meaning because of how we use it. But how can we use that word to determine a standard when we can’t know what that standard is? The Truth-Value Gap Theory Another  theory,  the  truth-value  gap  theory,  states  that  we  cannot  know the  cutoff  point  because  there  is  no  specific  cutoff  point.  Intuition  tells  us there exists a group of people for which saying they are bald is simply true, and there exists another group of people for which saying they are bald is simply  false.  However,  there  also  exists  a  group  of  people  in  the  middle. For these people in the middle, calling them bald is not saying anything true or false. For these people, the word bald is undefined. According  to  the  truth-value  gap  theory,  because  sentences  can  be undefined  instead  of  true,  not  all  of  the  premises  are  true.  However,  even the truth-value gap theory runs into problems. If  you  were  to  look  at  the  sentence  “It  is  either  raining  or  not  raining,” normally you would consider this to be a logical truth. However, under the truth-value  gap  theory,  if  there  were  a  borderline  case  of  rain,  both  “It  is raining”  and  “It  is  not  raining”  would  be  undefined,  and  therefore  neither would be true. Supervaluationism Supervaluationism  attempts  to  solve  the  problem  of  the  middle  group discussed  in  the  truth-value  gap  theory.  When  looking  at  the  baldness example, there are examples of thinly haired men for whom it would not be true  to  say  that  they  are  bald  (as  dictated  by  the  rules  of  being  “bald”); however,  it  would  not  be  false  to  say  they  are  bald,  either.  Therefore,  it seems to be up to us to determine these cases. In  supervaluationism,  drawing  the  line  between  baldness  and  non- baldness  is  referred  to  as  a  “sharpening”  of  the  term  bald.  While  simple sentences regarding borderline scenarios can lack a truth-value, compounds of these sentences will in fact have truth-values, and supervaluationism will allow  for  standard  logic  to  be  retained  (even  with  the  existence  of  truth- value  gaps).  With  this  idea  of  sharpening,  supervaluationism  states  the following: A sentence is true if and only if it is true with regard to all sharpenings. A sentence is false if and only if it is false with regard to all sharpenings. A sentence is undefined if and only if it is true with regard to some sharpenings and false with regard to other sharpenings. So  according to  supervaluationism,  premises  of the  sorites  paradox  will be true regarding some sharpenings, false regarding other sharpenings, and therefore,  some  will  be  undefined.  This  allows  for  there  to  be  valid reasoning with a false conclusion. However,  even  supervaluationism  has  its  problems  as  a  theory. Supervaluationism states “It is either raining or not raining” is always true even  if  neither  event  is  true.  If  we  return  to  the  idea  of  baldness, supervaluationism would assert that the statement “If you have 130 hairs on your head, you are not bald, but if you have one less, you are bald” is false, while  also  claiming  “There  is  a  number  of  hairs  with  which  you  are  not bald,  and  if  you  have  one  less,  you  are  bald”  is  true.  There  is  clearly  a contradiction here.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Ludwig  Wittgenstein  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  most  important philosophers  of  the  twentieth  century,  and  his  influence  is  particularly significant in analytic philosophy. Wittgenstein was born on April 26, 1889, in  Vienna,  Austria,  to  one  of  Austria’s  richest  families.  In  1908, to  study  aeronautical Wittgenstein  attended  Manchester  University engineering,  and  he  soon  became  extremely  interested  in  the  work  of Gottlob Frege and the philosophy of mathematics. From 1911 to 1913, based on the advice of Frege, Wittgenstein studied at Cambridge under Bertrand Russell. At Cambridge, Wittgenstein and Frege worked  together  on  understanding  the  foundations  of  logic.  Periodically, Wittgenstein would leave for Norway, where he would stay for months at a time and attempt to solve the problems they had discussed. At the start of World  War  I  in  1914,  Wittgenstein  joined  the  Austrian  army.  In  1917,  he was  captured  and  spent  the  remainder  of  the  war  as  a  prisoner  of  war. During  his  time  at  war,  Wittgenstein  began  to  write  one  of  his  most important philosophical works, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which was published in both German and English after the war. This would eventually become known as “early Wittgenstein.” By  1920,  Wittgenstein  had  stopped  pursuing  philosophy,  believing  that his work in Tractatus had solved all of philosophy’s problems. He gave his share  of  his  family’s  fortune  away  to  his  siblings,  and  for  the  next  nine years, he tried several different professions in Vienna. In 1929, after talking to members of the Vienna Circle about the philosophy of math and science, Wittgenstein  decided  to  return  to  Cambridge  and  study  philosophy.  His return  to  Cambridge  marked  a  dramatic  shift  in  his  philosophy,  and  the various  lectures,  conversations,  and  letters  from  this  time  are  sometimes referred  to  as  “middle  Wittgenstein.”  It  is  during  this  “middle”  phase  that Wittgenstein  rejects  dogmatic  philosophy  (which  included  not  only traditional  philosophical  works,  but  also  the  ideas  put  forth  in  his  own book). Wittgenstein  spent  the  1930s  and  1940s  conducting  seminars  at Cambridge.  During  this  time  period  (referred  to  as  “later  Wittgenstein”), Wittgenstein  developed  his  most  significant  works,  which  included revolutionary  ideas  regarding  a  shift  from  formal  logic  to  ordinary language, a skepticism toward the pretensions of philosophy, and reflections on  mathematics  and  psychology.  Though  he  had  planned  to  put  all  of  his ideas  into  a  second  book  entitled  Philosophical  Investigations,  in  1945, while  preparing  the  final  manuscript,  he  withdrew  the  book  from publication (but allowed for it to be published posthumously). Wittgenstein spent  the  next  few  years  traveling  and  further  developing  his  philosophy until his death in 1951.']...\n",

      "Content: ['The  philosophy  of  early  Wittgenstein  is  based  on  his  book,  Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.  Wittgenstein  draws  heavily  from  the  work  of Bertrand  Russell  and  Gottlob  Frege,  and  opposes  Russell’s  and  Frege’s universalist view of logic, in which logic is the ultimate set of laws and is the foundation upon which knowledge is built. There are seven basic propositions in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, as translated by D. F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness: 1. The world is all that is the case. 2. What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs. 3. A logical picture of facts is a thought. 4. A thought is a proposition with sense. 5. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions (an elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself). 6. The general form of a truth-function is . 7. What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence. Essentially, Wittgenstein  argues that logic has no laws, and cannot  be a set  of  laws,  because  logic  is  something  completely  different  from  the sciences. The very assumption that logic has laws is the result of assuming that logic is a science, but logic is something else entirely. Logic is strictly form and has no content. While on its own, logic says absolutely nothing, logic is what determines the structure and form of all that is talked about. Wittgenstein then tackles the role  of language.  According to Wittgenstein, language is only appropriate to use for describing facts in the world. He argues that language is unsuitable for speaking of things such as value,  ideas  that  relate  to  something  outside  of  the  world,  or  things  that discuss the world in general (thus claiming that a large part of philosophy, including aesthetics, ethics, and metaphysics, cannot be dealt with through language). For  example,  one’s  ethical  view  is  the  result  of  the  way  in  which  one views the world and lives. So therefore, how could this be put into words and be expressed as a law? Wittgenstein asserts that one’s ethical view (as well as much of philosophy) is something that can only be shown and not stated.  He  then  redefines  the  purpose  of  philosophy  and  states  that philosophy is not a doctrine, and therefore, it should not be approached in a dogmatic  fashion.  The  philosopher,  according  to  Wittgenstein,  should  use logical  analysis  to  show  where  traditional  philosophers  went  wrong  (he refers  to  all  propositions  as  nonsense)  and  should  correct  those  who  say things  that  are  not  sayable.  By  referring  to  propositions  as  nonsense, Wittgenstein even admits that his own book has become dangerously close to nonsense.']...\n",

      "Content: ['While  Wittgenstein’s  Tractatus  claimed  philosophy  should  not  be approached dogmatically, Wittgenstein came to the realization that his very own  work  was  dogmatic.  Thus,  his  later  works,  and  particularly  his  book Philosophical  Investigations,  are  most notable  for  their  complete rejection of dogmatism. In doing so, he moves away from logic and toward what he believes should be the foundation of every philosopher, ordinary language. In  his  book,  Wittgenstein  details  a  new  way  to  view  language  and  claims that the purpose of philosophy should be therapeutic. In  discussing  the  meaning  of  words,  Wittgenstein  claims  that  the meanings of words are determined by how one uses the words, and not by some  type  of  abstract  link  between  reality  and  language  (a  drastic  change from Wittgenstein’s earlier perspective). Meanings of words are not fixed or limited.  The  meaning  of  a  word  can  be  vague  or  fluid  and  still  be  just  as useful. To  support  his  claims  that  words  are  not  fixed  and  have  a  multitude  of uses,  Wittgenstein  introduces  what  he  calls  “language-games”  and  returns to  the  idea  frequently  throughout  his  book.  While  he  refers  to  language- games,  Wittgenstein  never  fully  defines  what  the  term  means,  so  as  to further show the fluidity and diversification of language. Though there is no specific or rigid definition, there is no difficulty in understanding the term and  using  it  in  the  correct  way.  Thus,  Wittgenstein  proves  that  ordinary language  is  adequate  the  way  it  currently  stands,  and  that  trying  to  dig beneath  the  surface  of  language  results  in  nothing  more  than  unwarranted generalizations. A  large  part  of  Philosophical  Investigations  pertains  to  the  language  of psychology.  When  we  use  words  like  thinking,  intending,  understanding, and  meaning,  the  temptation  is  to  believe  that  these  words  indicate  our mental  processes.  By  examining  how  these  words  are  used,  Wittgenstein concludes that these words do not refer to a mental state at all; instead, they refer to an individual’s behavior. Wittgenstein  comes  to  see  that  language  and  customs  are  not  fixed  by laws  but  by  the  use  of  language  in  social  contexts  (which  Wittgenstein refers  to  as  “forms  of  life”).  Therefore,  individuals  learn  how  to  use language,  at  its very core,  in  social  contexts,  which is  why we  are  able  to understand one another. This is also the reason that it is not possible for one to create his own language to describe inner sensations (for there would be no  way  of  knowing  whether  a  word  was  used  correctly,  and  thus,  the language would be meaningless). Wittgenstein  discusses  interpretation  through  the  difference  between “seeing  that”  and  “seeing  as.”  Look  at  the  example  made  famous  by Wittgenstein, the “duckrabbit.” “Seeing that” is when something is seen in a straightforward manner (for example,  we  see  that  it  is  a  duck),  and  “seeing  as”  is  when  one  begins  to notice  particular  aspects  (for  example,  we  see  it  as  a  rabbit).  In  seeing something as  something,  we  are  actually  interpreting.  We  do  not  interpret the things we see except when we acknowledge that there is more than one interpretation to be had. While  both  the  early  and  later  work  of  Wittgenstein  support  an  anti- theoretical  stance  on  what  philosophy  should  and  should  not  be, Wittgenstein dramatically shifts from using logic to prove the impossibility of  philosophical  theories  to  encouraging  the  therapeutic  nature  of philosophy.']...\n",

Not  only  does  aesthetics  focus  on  the  value  and  nature  of art;  it  also  involves  the  reactions  to  natural  objects  that  then  become expressions  in  language—thus,  objects  are  deemed  beautiful  or  ugly.

The  immediacy  thesis  states  that  we  do  not  conclude  through reason that something is beautiful; instead, we “taste” that it is beautiful. While a rationalist might object to this theory by stating that there is a big difference  between  finding  a  meal  excellent  and  finding  a  play  to  be excellent, the theory of taste states that a play is more complicated, and so it involves  more  cognitive  work,  which  includes  applying  various  concepts and principles. Therefore, determining the beauty of something like a play is  not  immediate  and  cannot  be  a  matter  of  taste.  The  theory  of  beauty  is immediate,  unlike  the  earlier  ideas  that  were  based  on  rationalist  thought, and  that  when  it  comes  to  judging  whether  a  play  is  beautiful,  it  simply cannot  be  a  matter  of  taste  because  this  action  requires  more  cognitive processes and is not immediate.

People  are  able  to  judge something as beautiful or not beautiful without serving their own interests. Philosophers believed that determining virtue works in a similar way. Kant questioned  this  notion  that  both  virtue  and  taste  are  disinterested.  Kant’s view,  which  is  the  current  view,  was  that  while  taste  is  disinterested,  the pleasure  that  comes  from  determining  whether  an  action  is  morally  good must be interested because that judgment represents a desire to perform that action.']...\n",

According  to  Putnam’s  semantic externalism,  the  meaning  of  a  word  is  determined  (either  partially  or entirely) by factors that are external to the speaking individual. While other theories  believed  the  process  of  gaining  meaning  was  internal  (within  the head),  Putnam’s  semantic  externalism  claimed  that  the  process  of  gaining semantics is outside the head. In other words, as Putnam famously stated, “ ‘meanings’ just ain’t in the head!” According to Putnam, the meaning of any term in a language consists of a specific sequence of elements: 1. The object that the term is referring to (in the case of Twin Earth, this is the substance with the chemical makeup of H2O). 2. The typical terms (known as “stereotypes”) that are often associated with the term (like the terms odorless, colorless, and hydrating that water is often associated with). 3. The semantic indicators that categorize the object (like liquid). 4. The syntactic indicators (for example, a mass noun—a type of noun that has terms being referred to that are not considered to be separate entities). Based  on  his  ideas  of  semantic  externalism,  Putnam  goes  on  to  explain his causal theory of reference. He claims that words gain their referents as the result of a chain of causation that ends at the referent. For example, one still has the ability to reference the pyramids in Egypt even if he has never seen  them  because  the  concept  of  what  the  pyramids  are  still  exists.  How can  this  be?  It  is  because  the  term  has  been  acquired  as  a  result  of interacting  with  others  (who,  to  acquire  their  knowledge,  had  interacted with others, who had acquired their knowledge by interacting with others, etc.).  This  pattern  continues  until  it  eventually  reaches  a  person  who  had firsthand  experience  with  the  subject  matter.  Because  of  this  chain  of causation, one is able to discuss something without ever having experienced it firsthand.']...\n",

(For  example,  an intrinsic  property  of  a  penny  is  that  it  is  round,  while  a  penny  being  in someone’s  pocket  is  an  extrinsic  property.)  The  narrow  content  of  one’s belief about an object has to be shared by every duplicate of that individual object. Some  who  believe  narrow  mental  content  to  be  true  claim  that  mental content  and  behavior  are  the  results  of  a  causal  consequence  from  our beliefs.  In  other  words,  we  act  the  way  we  do  because  of  our  beliefs  and desires. Others claim that people have introspective access to their thoughts, meaning we should have the ability to determine whether the same content is  contained  in  two  of  our  thoughts.  According  to  this  claim,  the  two Oscars, unaware of the chemical makeup of H2O and XYZ, have no way of knowing  whether  their  thoughts  are  H2O-related  thoughts  or  XYZ-related thoughts  because  they  are  not  even  aware  the  other  water-like  substance even  exists.  To  make  sense  of  this,  philosophers  created  the  notion  of “slow-switching.” What if Oscar were to move to Twin Earth? At first, he will continue to have water-thoughts about this substance, but the longer he interacts with XYZ and the longer he is away from H2O, he will come to just  think  of  XYZ  and  not  about  H2O.  Over  time,  his  water-thoughts  will have  a  different  broad  content  (and  Oscar  would  not  be  aware  of  this change  because  his  thoughts  would  seem  to  have  the  same  content  as  it always  did).  In  order  to  have  introspective  access  and  see  that  these contents  are  different,  we  need  narrow  mental  content  and  not  broad content. Narrow mental content is controversial to philosophers; many reject it in favor  of  broad  mental  content.  Putnam’s  Twin  Earth  is  the  most  famous example of why broad mental content makes more sense. Both Oscars have the exact same intrinsic properties; however, they are referring to different substances. Therefore, intrinsic properties are not enough to determine what the  Oscars  are  referring  to.

When Schopenhauer was a young man, his father, a merchant, offered the academically inclined Arthur a proposition: he could either  prepare  to  go  to  a  university,  or  he  could  travel  across  Europe  with his parents and then take an apprenticeship with a merchant upon returning from their travels. Schopenhauer chose to travel with his family, and on this journey he witnessed firsthand the terrible suffering of the poor throughout Europe. This experience would greatly influence the pessimistic worldview he would later become known for as a philosopher. Upon  returning  from  his  trip  across  Europe,  Schopenhauer  began  to prepare for his career by holding up his end of the bargain and becoming an apprentice  for  a  merchant.  When  Schopenhauer  was  just  seventeen  years old,  his  father  died  (in  what  is  believed  to  have  been  a  suicide),  and  two years later, Schopenhauer left the apprenticeship and pursued his academic career. While  Schopenhauer  attended  school,  his  mother,  who  had  moved  to Weimar,  started  to  become  frequently  engaged  in  intellectual  and  social circles.  As  she  worked  as  a  writer  and  hostess  for  a  salon  that  was frequented by many influential thinkers of the time, she introduced her son to  Johann Wolfgang  von Goethe (with  whom  he would eventually write  a theory  on  colors)  and  Friedrich  Majer  (who  sparked  Schopenhauer’s interest  in  Eastern  thought).  Schopenhauer’s  relationship  with  his  mother would  grow  to  become  so  tense  that  when  he  was  thirty  years  old,  his mother told him to never talk to her again. By 1809, now attending the University of Göttingen, Schopenhauer had studied  medicine  until  his  third  semester,  when  he  decided  to  shift  to philosophy.  Schopenhauer  would  eventually  transfer  to  the  University  of Berlin to continue his philosophical studies. In 1813, due to the onslaught of  Napoleon’s  Grande  Armée,  Schopenhauer  fled  to  the  small  town  of Rudolstadt,  where  he  would  go  on  to  write  The  Fourfold  Root  of  the Principle  of  Sufficient  Reason,  an  investigation  into  the  idea  of  sufficient reason.  By  the  next  year,  Schopenhauer  had  moved  to  Dresden,  where  he would  write  his  famous  color  theory,  On  Vision  and  Colors,  and  an overview  of  his  philosophical  system,  The  World  as  Will  and Representation. By  1820,  Schopenhauer  had  become  a  lecturer  at  the  University  of Berlin.  He  became  extremely  competitive  with  fellow  lecturer  Wilhelm Hegel, often scheduling his lectures at the same time as Hegel’s in order to make audiences choose one over the other. But while Hegel’s lectures were crowded  with  students,  Schopenhauer’s  lectures  had  very  few,  and Schopenhauer grew cynical and felt alienated from the academic world. It was only in his later years that his work finally gained traction and became fashionable throughout Europe.']...\n",

Schopenhauer  stated  that  in  order  to  use  the  principle  of sufficient reason, one has to be able to think of something that would then need to be explained, which means there must be the presence of a subject to  begin  with.

It is here that we see Schopenhauer’s commitment to pessimism and view of humanity in a negative light, which persists  throughout  the  body  of  his  work.  The  “Will,”  according  to Schopenhauer, brings about all of mankind’s suffering, and this suffering is the result of constantly desiring more. Schopenhauer concluded that human desire (and therefore human action) has no direction or logic and is futile. He claimed that the world is not only a  terrible  place  (with  things  like  cruelty,  disease,  suffering,  etc.);  it  is  the worst  of  worlds,  and  if  it  could  be  even  slightly  worse,  it  would  cease  to exist.']...\n",

Compassion: This, according to Schopenhauer, is the only genuine thing that can drive moral acts, for only the good of an act is sought out, and cannot occur from a sense of duty or personal benefit.

      "Content: ['Karl  Marx  was  born  on  May  5,  1818,  in  Prussia.  Marx’s  father  was  a successful  lawyer  involved  in  the  Prussian  reform  movement,  and  valued the work of Voltaire and Kant. Though both of Kant’s parents were Jewish, his father converted to Lutheranism as the result of an 1815 law that banned Jews from having full citizenship rights. Karl Marx  attended  the  University  of Bonn  in  1835,  before  transferring to the University of Berlin at the request of his father (who considered it to be  a  more  serious  school).  At  the  University  of  Berlin,  Marx  started studying law before switching to philosophy, and began to learn the work of Hegel. Soon, Marx would become part of a radical group of students known as  the  Young  Hegelians,  who  criticized  the  religious  and  political establishments of the time. In 1841, Marx earned his doctorate from the University of Jena, where he wrote his dissertation on ancient Greek natural philosophy. He was denied a teaching  position  because  of  his  radical  political  ideologies.  Marx  then began working as a journalist, and became editor of the liberal newspaper Rheinische Zeitung in 1842. Only one year later, however, the government shut  down  the  paper.  Marx  then  married  and  moved  to  Paris,  where,  in 1844, he would collaborate with Friedrich Engels in writing a criticism of Bruno  Bauer  (a  former  friend  and  Young  Hegelian).  Marx  was  soon expelled from France for once again writing for another radical newspaper (this newspaper had close ties to an organization that would eventually turn into the Communist League), so he moved to Brussels. During his time in Brussels, Karl Marx broke away from the ideology of the Young Hegelians upon being introduced to the ideas of socialism. While living in Brussels, Marx developed his theory of historical materialism that would appear in his The German Ideology and wrote Theses on Feuerbach (which  would  not  be  published  until  after  his  death  because  he  could  not find a publisher willing to publish the books). In 1846, in an attempt to connect socialists across Europe, Marx created a Communist  Correspondence  Committee.  The  ideas  set  forth  by  Marx inspired socialists in England to form the Communist League, and in 1847, at the request of the Central Committee that was meeting in London, Marx and Engels wrote Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei (commonly known as The Communist Manifesto). The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848, and as a result, Karl Marx was expelled from Belgium in 1849. After being  deported from France  and refused  renaturalization by Prussia, Marx eventually  ended  up  in  London,  where  he  participated  in  the  development of  the  German  Workers’  Educational  Society  and  created  the  new headquarters for the Communist League. In 1867, Marx published the first volume of his treatise on economics, Das Kapital, which is considered to be his greatest achievement. Marx spent the remainder of his life working on the  manuscripts  for  the  next  two  volumes;  however,  he  died  before  their completion, and the books were subsequently published after his death.']...\n",

Hegel  claimed  that  history, too, had a similar dialectical view; contradictions of a specific time period lead  to  a  newer  time  period  attempting  to  smooth  over  those  previous contradictions. While Marx agreed with much of Hegel’s view on history, Hegel was an idealist  and  Marx  considered  himself  to  be  a  materialist.  So  while  Hegel believed  that  ideas  are  the  primary  way  in  which  people  relate  to  their surroundings and that one is able to understand history based on ideas that are representative of that time period, Marx believed that the ways societies are  organized  during  a  time  period  in  history  is  actually  the  fundamental truth regarding that society.

Marx claimed that labor is not  only  an  act  of  personal  creation;  it  is  a  display  of  one’s  identity  and survival. Marx  states  that  the  worker  under  capitalism,  however,  with  it  being  a system based on private ownership, takes away the self-worth and identity that  is  essential  to  the  worker.  The  worker,  now  distant  from  the  product, becomes alienated from his work, himself, and his coworkers. There is no longer a personal sense of satisfaction for the worker, and he now views his work as simply a way to survive. Because the worker is estranged from the work process and since labor is a key component to one’s self, the worker must  also  be  estranged  from  his  self  and  from  humanity  as  a  whole.  The constant alienation that is formed by capitalism thus creates the antagonistic relationship discussed in historical materialism, and will eventually lead to the destruction of capitalism.']...\n",

All commodities  are  the  products  of  labor,  and  according  to  Karl  Marx,  a commodity’s value should not be determined by something like supply and demand; rather, its value should be based on the amount of labor that went into creating that commodity.

This idea is then taken advantage of,  and  capitalists  create  wages  and  working  hours  to  get  the  most  labor with  the  least  cost,  and  then  sell  for  more  than  they  paid,  not  by  the commodity’s exchange-value.

Marx then describes  the  “relations  of  production”  as  the  relationships  between  those who do not own the means of production (like the workers) and those who do  (like  the  bourgeoisie  or  capitalists).  Karl  Marx  claimed  that  history’s evolution  is  the  result  of  the  mode  of  production  interacting  with  the relations of production. As the mode of production continues to evolve to the fullest  productive  capacity,  hostility  among  classes  in  accordance  with  the relations  of  production  begins  to  form  (in  other  words,  it  becomes  the owners versus the workers). The mode of production known as capitalism, according to Marx, is based on  the  fact  that  the  means  of  production  is  based  on  private  ownership. Capitalism is based on the idea of getting the most out of labor for the lowest cost, and workers are only paid enough so that they can be kept alive and can continue to produce. Marx claims that the workers will come to understand the  exploitation  and  antagonistic  nature  of  capitalism,  and  that  this  will ultimately  lead  to  the  overthrow  of  capitalism  by  the  working  class.

Thus,  in  capitalism, the  market  price  of  a  commodity  in  everyday  life  not  only  depends  upon exploitation;  it  also  masks  the  exploitation  of  workers.

Messkirch  was  a  rural  town  that  was  deeply  conservative  and religious,  and  this  upbringing  would  have  a  profound  impact  on Heidegger’s  philosophical  career.  In  1909,  Heidegger  began  studying theology at the University of Freiburg, but by 1911, he had shifted his focus toward philosophy. Though  incredibly  influenced  by  many  philosophers,  the  impact  of Aristotle’s  Metaphysics,  and  particularly  Aristotle’s  desire  to  understand what unites the different modes of being, would have a profound effect on Heidegger. This, along with the work of Edmund Husserl, whom Heidegger worked  for  as  an  assistant  in  1919  and  whose  chair  he  would  take  over when Husserl retired, led him to his most famous work: Being and Time. Being  and  Time  was  published  in  1927  and  was  praised  for  being  an incredibly significant text of continental philosophy. It is still considered to be one of the single most important works of the twentieth century, and is viewed as an impetus for many of the greatest philosophical thinkers. Following the publication of Being and Time, there was a noticeable shift in  Heidegger’s  philosophy,  which  Heidegger  referred  to  as  “the  turn.”  To Heidegger,  the  turn  was  not  a  shift  in  his  thinking,  but  rather  a  shift  in Being. Heidegger described the elements of the turn in what is considered to be his second most important work, Contributions to Philosophy, which was not published in German until 1989, even though it was written around 1936. Heidegger became a member of the Nazi Party in 1933 and was elected rector of Freiburg University.  While  accounts of his  time  as rector vary— some  say  he  enthusiastically  brought  Nazi  policy  into  the  university education,  while  others  claim  he  allowed  the  implementation  of  policy while  holding  an  underground  resistance  movement  toward  some  of  the details  of  the  Nazi  policy  (such  as  anti-Semitism)—Heidegger  was  not rector  for  long,  resigning  from  the  position  in  1934.  That  same  year, Heidegger began to grow distant from the Nazi Party, even though he never officially  left  it.  When  World  War  II  ended,  the  University  of  Freiburg’s denazification  committee  investigated  Heidegger  and  banned  him  from teaching. The ban would last until 1949, when the following year he would become professor emeritus.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Being  and  Time  is  Martin  Heidegger’s  most  important  and  complex philosophical work, and it skyrocketed Heidegger into becoming one of the most significant philosophers of the twentieth century. Heidegger  examined  the  metaphysical  question  of  what  it  means  to  be “being.”  He  begins  by  looking  at  the  work  of  Descartes,  who  claimed  that being is divided into three different types of substances: 1. Entities that do not need other entities 2. Res cogitans (nonmaterial substances) 3. Res extensa (material substances) According to Heidegger, this idea of Being leads to “indefinite difference” because  there  is  the  assumption  that  Being  can  exist  in  all  three  of  these possibilities,  and  that  simply  does  not  make  sense.  Secondly,  Heidegger concluded  that  Descartes’s  belief  of  Being  is  incorrect,  for  Descartes’s findings simply show the world to be made up of res extensa and that Being simply means “knowing another object.” Heidegger, on the other hand, believed the best way to understand Being is  by  looking  internally  and  interrogating  our  own  selves.  Therefore,  he concluded, the Being is us. He referred to this as Dasein, meaning “Being- there,” and this, according to Heidegger, is Being asking itself the question of  what  Being  is.  Therefore,  Dasein  is  a  self-interpreting  Being,  one  that says  “I,”  and  one  that  has  a  “mineness.”  Self-interpretation,  therefore,  is existence. Heidegger then goes on to clarify that there are three modes of Being: 1. Dasein 2. Presence-at-hand (things that exist by looking, observing something, and only becoming concerned with the bare facts and concepts) 3. Readiness-at-hand (the Being possessed by things like equipment, where not only are they useable; they have always been manipulatable because of their Being) In  Dasein,  the  normal  mode  of  existence  is  neither  authentic  nor inauthentic because it is an average everydayness—it is like life is living a person, and not the person living life. In  Heidegger’s  opinion,  conceptions  of  the  subject  are  incorrect  because the subject becomes converted into an object. Rather, the subject should be seen  as  “Being-in-the-world.”  Instead  of  the  environment  being  filled  with objects, it is filled with things. These things are called Zeug, meaning “gear,” and  are  used  for  accomplishing  projects.  Zeug  is  only  significant  or meaningful if it is what it is within the specific project(s) it appears in, or if it is what it is when compared to other things that are part of the project(s). Therefore,  Zeug’s  particular  Being  is  that  of  readiness-at-hand.  A  thing’s Being is given to it, as that thing, through the context of a project of Dasein and  the  context  of  other  things  involved  in  that  project.  In  other  words, things  already  are  what  they  are  due  to  their  place  in  reference  to  other things. Dasein cannot make meaning, however, for it is not a unitary entity that is completely  self-present.  The  individuality  of  Dasein  creates  a  unique,  but flawed,  perspective,  because  it  is  always  in  relation  to  other  things  and always  in  a  world  inhabited  by  other  things.  The  gear  (like  language, projects, and words) is not for one person alone, so therefore Dasein is what Heidegger refers to as “they-self.” Heidegger concludes that the Being of Dasein is time. While, as a mortal, Dasein runs from birth until death, Dasein’s access to the world is through tradition and history. From  left  to  right:  Gewesenheit  means  “living  past”  or  “been-ness.” Faktizität means “thrown-ness” because, according to Heidegger, people are thrown into the  world. Zeug  means  “equipment”  and  is  the  object  that  one has  meaningful  dealings  with.  Sorge  means  “care”  or  “concern,”  which, according to Heidegger, is the fundamental basis of one’s being-in-the-world because  it  creates  drive  in  us.  Verfallenheit  means  “fallen”  or  “estranged.” Geworfenheit means “being thrown.” In-der-Welt-Sein means “Being-in-the- world.” Gegenwart  means  “present.”  Mitsein  means  “Being-with.”  Zukunft means “future.” Existenzialität means “existentiality.”']...\n",

      "Header: THE TURN\n",
      "Content: ['Sometime  after  World  War  II,  Heidegger’s  work  began  to  shift  focus. Heidegger  began focusing on how behavior on its own is  dependent  upon an  already  existing  “openness  to  being.”  Heidegger  stated  that  the maintenance  of  this  prior  openness  is  the  essence  of  being  human,  and claimed  that  the  modern  human  is  forgetting  about  this  openness. According  to  Heidegger,  this  type  of  openness  was  authentic  during  the days  of  pre-Socratic  philosophers  like  Heraclitus  and  Anaximander; however,  it  started  to  become  forgotten  with  the  philosophical  works  of Plato. Heidegger  also  became  interested  in  technology  and  poetry,  believing that both are contrasting methods of “revealing” Being. While the creation of  new  poetry  has  the  ability  to  reveal  Being,  new  technology  “frames” existence  (his  notion known of Gestell)  and  further  reveals  the  distinction between subject and object. Heidegger said that while technology may play a role in allowing humans to have a new understanding of their Being, the framing  that  technology  has  created  threatens  mankind’s  ability  to  reveal and experience the more primal truth.']...\n",

The work Voltaire produced during his lifetime was so varied that it can be hard  to  classify  him  as  a  philosopher  in  the  traditional  sense.  Besides philosophy,  Voltaire  also  wrote  plays,  novels,  historical  pieces,  poetry, essays, and scientific texts. Voltaire  was  born  into  a  middle-class  family;  his  mother  came  from  a noble family, and his father was a minor treasury official and notary. At the age  of  seven,  Voltaire’s  mother  passed  away,  and  Voltaire  became  close with his godfather, Chateauneuf, a freethinker who would have an immense impact on his life and teach the young Voltaire about literature, deism, and to renounce superstitions. From  1704  to  1711,  Voltaire  attended  the  Collège  Louis-le-Grand  in Paris,  where  he  received  a  classical  education  and  was  adept  at  learning languages  (while  he  had  already  learned  Greek  and  Latin  when  he  was younger, he later also became fluent in English, Spanish, and Italian).

Eventually,  Voltaire’s  father  found  out  and  sent  his  son  to  law school,  but  Voltaire  continued  to  pursue  his  passion,  and  he  began circulating in intellectual circles.']...\n",

In  1717,  while  still  in  his  twenties,  Voltaire  was imprisoned for eleven months at the infamous Bastille prison for writing  defamatory  poetry  about  the  regent  for  King  Louis  XV. During  his  stay  at  the  Bastille,  he  wrote  his  first  play,  Oedipe, which  became  a  success,  and  by  1718,  he  had  taken  on  the name  “Voltaire”  (which  was  a  play  on  words),  and  this  is  often considered  the  point  at  which  he  formally  separated  from  his past. From  1726  to  1729,  after  offending  a  nobleman,  Voltaire  was  forced  to live in exile in England. While in England, Voltaire was introduced to the ideas  of  John  Locke,  Sir  Isaac  Newton,  and  Britain’s  constitutional monarchy,  which  embraced  freedom  of  religion  and  freedom  of  speech. Upon  returning  to  Paris,  Voltaire  wrote  of  his  experience  and  views  of Britain  and  published  Philosophical  Letters  on  the  English  in  1733.  This was  met  with  an  incredible  amount  of  controversy  from  the  French government and church, and Voltaire was once again forced to flee Paris. Voltaire  lived  in  exile  in  northeastern  France  for  the  next  fifteen  years with  Émilie  du Châtelet,  his  lover  and collaborator. He  continued  to  write in works in  science,  history,  fiction,  and  philosophy  (particularly metaphysics, concentrating on the legitimacy of the Bible and the existence of God). Not only did Voltaire call for religious freedom and the separation of church and state; he had renounced religion entirely. When  du  Châtelet  died  in  1749,  Voltaire  moved  to  Potsdam  to  work under  Frederick  the  Great.  By  1753,  however,  Voltaire  once  again  found himself  in  great  controversy  when  he  attacked  the  president  of  the  Berlin Academy of Sciences. Voltaire then spent a period of time traveling city to city;  however,  due  to  his  many  bans,  he  eventually  ended  up  close  to  the Swiss border (it was here that he wrote his famous Candide). At  the  age  of  eighty-three,  Voltaire  finally  returned  to  Paris  in  1778, where he received a hero’s welcome. He died on May 30 of that same year.']...\n",

In relativism, there are some ideas that are more central than others. If  a  feature  plays  a  prominent  role  in  the  development  of  a  group’s beliefs, it is considered to be a central concept. When philosophers refer to something as a central belief, that means the belief is so critical to a group or  individual  that  if  it  were  to  be  abandoned,  other  beliefs  would  be abandoned  as  a  result.  For  example,  the  notion  that  physical  objects  still exist even if no one is around to perceive them can be viewed as a central belief,  while  the  idea  that  kings  have  the  right  to  rule  the  land  based  on divine right is not a lasting belief, and therefore not a central belief. Central concepts  and  central  beliefs  are  related  to  one  another  and  often  involve each other. With that said, centrality is not black-and-white and often comes in degrees.

Perception Is Not Completely Theory-Laden The theory of descriptive perceptual relativism states that perception may be partially theory-laden; however, it is not as severely theory-laden as those who subscribe to extreme relativism would claim it to be. This theory further weakens  the  notion  that  perception  is  theory-laden  because  it  also  shows support for several different forms of normative relativism. The  extent  to  which  our  perceptions  are  influenced  by  concepts, expectations,  and  beliefs  is  still  controversial,  but  most  philosophers  agree that these factors play a critical role. After all, we still talk of the sun rising and setting. And this is almost four centuries after Kepler’s groundbreaking work!

One of the most popular versions of the mediation problem states that one is not able to think without having concepts, or talk without words. Therefore, it is impossible to go beyond our concepts or words in order to assess how the world truly is. The Unintelligibility That Results from Extrapolation Relativism  often  involves  drawing  conclusions  about  one  group  that  is different  from  another  group.  However,  just  because  one  can  coherently imagine concepts and beliefs that differ in some small way, does not mean that one can imagine concepts and beliefs that differ in great ways.

Samkhya The  oldest  of  the  orthodox  philosophical  schools  is  Samkhya.  This philosophical  system  states  that  all  things  in  reality  come  from  prakriti (meaning  energy,  matter,  and  creative  agency)  and  purusha  (meaning  the soul, mind, or self). Samkhya is based on dualism; however, unlike Western philosophy’s definition of dualism as being between the mind and body, the dualism  of  Samkhya  is  based  on  the  soul  (an  eternal,  indivisible,  and absolute  reality  that  is  pure  consciousness)  and  matter.  Total  liberation occurs  when  one  understands  the  differences  between  the  soul  and dispositions of matter (such as dullness, activity, and steadiness). Yoga The  Yoga  school  draws  upon  the  metaphysics  and  psychology  of Samkhya; however, it features the presence of a divine entity. The goal of Yoga, as laid out in the Yoga Sutras (written in the second century b.c.), is to  quiet  the  mind  in  order  to  attain  a  solitariness  or  detachment  known  as kaivalya. Nyaya The  Nyaya  philosophical  school  greatly  influenced  many  other  Indian schools  of  thought.  The  Nyaya  philosophy  is  based  on  a  system  of  logic, and  followers  believe  that  obtaining  knowledge  that  is  valid  comes  from inference, perception, testimony, and comparison. By obtaining knowledge in these ways, one becomes released from suffering. The Nyaya school also created criteria to determine what knowledge is valid and what knowledge is invalid. Vaisheshika Created  in  the  sixth  century  b.c.,  the  Vaisheshika  school  is  based  on pluralism  and  atomism.  According  to  Vaisheshika,  everything  in  the physical universe can be reduced to a finite number of atoms, and Brahman (the  ultimate  reality  behind  the  gods  and  the  universe)  is  what  creates consciousness in the atoms. Eventually, the Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools merged  together;  however,  Vaisheshika  only  accepted  the  sources  of  valid knowledge to be inference and perception. Purva Mimamsa The  Purva  Mimamsa  school  was  based  on  interpreting  the  Vedas  and being the authority on the sacred text. Purva Mimamsa involved an absolute faith  in  the  sacred  text  and  included  the  performance  of  fire-sacrifices  in order  to,  it  was  believed,  sustain  the  universe.  While  the  Purva  Mimamsa school believed in the philosophical and logical teachings of other schools, they  argued  that  the  only  way  one  could  attain  salvation  was  by  living  in accordance with the teachings of the Vedas. Later on, the Purva Mimamsa school shifted to insist that in order to release one’s soul, one must partake in enlightened activity. Vedanta The Vedanta school focused on the philosophical teachings of the mystic contemplations that were found within the Vedas, known as the Upanishads. The  Vedanta  school  emphasized  the  importance  of  meditation,  spiritual connectivity, and self-discipline.']...\n",

Indian Political Philosophy Political philosophy in India dates back to the fourth century b.c., with the Arthashastra,  a  text  that  discusses  economic  policy  and  statecraft.  In  the twentieth  century,  another  political  philosophy  was  made  popular  by Mahatma  Gandhi  and  was  greatly  influenced  by  the  writings  of  Jesus,  Leo Tolstoy, John Ruskin, Henry David Thoreau, and the Hindu Bhagavad Gita. Gandhi emphasized a political philosophy based on ahimsa, or nonviolence, and satyagraha, or nonviolent resistance. Buddhism The  philosophical  principles  of  Buddhism  are  based  on  the  Four  Noble Truths (the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path that frees one from suffering). Buddhism  advocates  that  in  order  to  end  suffering,  one  must  follow  the Noble  Eightfold  Path.  The  philosophy  of  Buddhism  touches  on  ethics, metaphysics,  epistemology,  phenomenology,  and  the  notion  that  God  is irrelevant. Jainism One  of  the  most  basic  ideas  in  Jainism  is  anekantavada,  the  notion  that different points of view perceive reality differently, and therefore, there are no  points  of  view  that  are  completely  true.  In  Jain  philosophy,  the  only people who have true knowledge and know the true answer are referred to as Kevalis; anyone else can only know part of an answer. Jainism places great emphasis  on  equality  of  life,  spiritual  independence,  nonviolence,  and  the fact that an individual’s behavior has immediate consequences.

Therefore, according to Avicenna, anything that comes into existence is the result of an essence allowing for that existence. His notion of essence and existence is similar to Plato’s theory of Forms (the idea that everything that exists falls under a pre-existing archetype and that  even  when  something  no  longer  exists,  the  archetype  remains); however, Avicenna claimed that Allah (the First Reality) is the only thing in the  world  that  was  not  preceded  by  an  essence.  Allah,  according  to Avicenna,  is  a  necessary  being  that  one  cannot  define.  If  one  attempts  to define  Allah,  the  very  act  of  defining  creates  opposition.

According  to  this  theory,  the creation of the world followed the First Intellect. The First Intellect begins to  contemplate  its  own  existence,  and  in  doing  so,  the  Second  Intellect  is created. As the Second Intellect begins to contemplate its origins from God, the  First  Spirit  is  created,  which  then  sparks  the  universe,  known  as  the Sphere  of  Spheres.  As  the  Sphere  of  Spheres  contemplates  that  it  is something that has the potential to exist, it creates matter. This matter fills the universe and creates the Sphere of the Planets. It  is  from  the  triple-contemplation  that  the  early  stages  of  existence emerge. As the process continues, two celestial hierarchies are created as a result  of  the  continuation  of  emerging  intellects:  the  Inferior  Hierarchy (which  Avicenna  refers  to  as  the  “Angels  of  Magnificence”)  and  the Superior Hierarchy of Cherubim. According to Avicenna, the angels, which are  responsible  for  prophetic  visions  in  humans,  are  deprived  of  sensory perception. They do, however, have imagination, and this imagination lets them  desire  the  intellect  that  they  originated  from.  The  angels’  journey  to rejoin with their respective intellect creates eternal movement in heaven. The  following  seven  intellects,  and  the  angels  created  by  them, correspond  to  different  bodies  within  the  Sphere  of  Planets.  They  are Jupiter,  Mars,  Saturn,  Venus,  Mercury,  the  sun,  and  the  moon  (which  is associated  with  the  Angel  Gabriel,  “The  Angel”).  It  is  from  the  ninth intellect that humans emerge (featuring the sensory functions that the angels lack). Avicenna then claims that the tenth and final intellect is human intellect. He  claims  that  on  its  own,  the  human  mind  is  not  formed  for  abstract thought.  Avicenna  claims  that  in  humans,  there  is  only  the  potential  for intellect,  and  that  this  potential  can  only  come  about  through  illumination by The Angel. This illumination can vary in degrees; prophets, for example, have  been  illuminated  so  much  that  they  can  have  rational  intellect, imagination,  and  the  ability  to  pass  their  information  on  to  others,  while other  people  might  have  only  enough  illumination  to  teach,  write,  pass down  information,  and  pass  laws,  and  others  might  receive  even  less illumination.

As the individual hangs in the air, he will experience complete isolation from his senses (which means that he will not even have sensory contact with his own body). Avicenna  argued  that  even  with  this  isolation  from  the  senses,  a  person would still have self-consciousness. If a person that is isolated from sense experience still has the ability to determine his own existence, according to Avicenna,  this  shows  that  the  soul  is  an  immaterial  substance  that  exists independent  of the  body. Avicenna  also  claimed that since  this scenario is conceivable,  it  points  to  the  conclusion  that  the  soul  is  perceived intellectually. Furthermore,  Avicenna  believed  that  the  brain  is  where  reason  and sensation interact with one another. In the scenario of the Floating Man, the very  first  knowledge  that  the  individual  would  have  is  “I  am,”  which affirms  that  individual’s  essence.  Because  the  individual  is  isolated  from sense experience, essence cannot come from the body. Therefore, the very core of a person is the knowledge “I am,” which means not only does the soul  exist;  the  soul  is  self-aware.

By the time Russell was just four years old, he had lost both his mother and father, and  he  and  his  older  brother  lived  with  their  very  strict  grandparents  (his grandfather,  Lord  John  Russell,  was  a  former  Prime  Minister  and  the  first Earl of Russell). When Russell was six years old, his grandfather had died too,  leaving  him  and  his  brother  with  only  their  grandmother.  At  a  young age,  Russell  wished  to  free  himself  from  the  household  filled  with prohibitions  and  rules,  and  this  desire,  as  well  as  a  distrust  of  religion, would have a profound impact on the rest of his life. In 1890, Russell attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled in mathematics and philosophy. Russell initially became quite interested in idealism (the idea that reality is a product of the mind), though years after leaving  Cambridge,  he  would  reject  idealism  entirely,  in  favor  of  realism (the  idea  that  consciousness  and  experience  exist  independently  from  the external  world)  and  empiricism  (the  idea  that  knowledge  comes  from sensory experiences from the external world). The  early  work  of  Bertrand  Russell  focused  on  mathematics.  Russell’s defense  of  logicism  (the  notion  that  all  mathematics  can  be  reduced  to appear as logical principles) was incredibly important, and if it were proven true,  it  would  show  that  mathematics  is  legitimately  a  priori  knowledge. While his philosophical ideas touched many subjects throughout the span of his  life  (including  morality,  the  philosophy  of  language,  metaphysics,  and linguistics), Russell always continued working in logic, and wrote a three- volume  book,  Principia  Mathematica,  to  show  that  all  mathematical principles, arithmetic, and numbers stem from logic.

Once a sentence has been broken down so much so that those small parts can no longer be broken down, those parts are considered to be “logical atoms.” If we then look  at  these  logical  atoms,  we  should  be  able  to  uncover  underlying assumptions of a sentence and then be able to better determine whether it is valid or true. For example, let’s take a look at the following sentence: “The king of the United States is bald.” This sentence seems simple; however, from it, we can break it down into three logical atoms. 1. The king of the United States exists. 2. There is one king of the United States. 3. The king of the United States does not have hair. Since we know that there is no king of the United States, the first atom proves to be false. Therefore, the sentence “The king of the United States is bald” is untrue. However, this does not necessarily mean it is properly false, because the opposite of this statement, “The king of the United States has hair,” is also untrue. In both cases, it is assumed that the United States has a king. Through logical atomism, we are able to see the validity and degree of truth.

Russell then claimed that this language  should  be  based  on  mathematical  logic  and  appear  more  like  a series of mathematical equations. In trying to answer the questions brought on by the sentence “The king of the  United  States  is  bald,”  Russell  created  his  theory  of  descriptions.  For Russell, definite descriptions are names, phrases, or words that pertain to a single, specific object (like “that table,” “Australia,” or “Steven Spielberg”). If  a  sentence  contains  definite  descriptions,  according  to  Russell,  it  is actually  a  shorthand  way  to  express  a  group  of  claims  within  a  series. Therefore, Russell was able to show that grammar obscures the logical form of  a  sentence.

      "Content: ['As Bertrand Russell attempted to reduce all types of mathematics into logic, the  notion  of  a  “set”  became  very  important.  Russell  defines  a  set  as  “a collection  of  members  or  elements”  (in  other  words,  objects).  Sets  can  be defined  negatively  or  feature  subsets,  which  can  then  be  added  or subtracted.  For  example,  a  set  might  be  all  Americans;  a  set  defined negatively might be all things that are not Americans; and a subset within a set might be all New Yorkers within the set of all Americans. While Bertrand Russell was not the first person to create set theory (that was  Gottlob  Frege),  Russell  completely  revolutionized  the  founding principles  of  the  theory  with  his  introduction  of  “Russell’s  paradox”  in 1901. Russell’s paradox deals with the set of every set that is not a member of itself.  For  example,  let’s  look  at  a  set  of  all  of  the  dogs  that  ever  existed. The set of every dog that ever existed is not also a dog, but there do exist some sets that are members of themselves. If we look at the set that is made up of everything that is not a dog, for example, this must mean that even the set has to be included because that set is also not a dog. When  one  tries  to  think  of  a  set  that  is  made  up  of  sets  that  aren’t members of themselves, the result is a paradox. Why? Because we see a set containing  sets  that  are  not  members  of  themselves,  and  yet  by  the  very definition  of  the  original  set  (a  set  that  is  made  up  of  sets  that  aren’t members  of  themselves),  this  means  that  it  must  also  include  itself. However, its very definition states that it cannot include itself, and therefore a contradiction appears. It is from Russell’s paradox that we see the imperfections of set theory. By calling any group of objects a set, situations that are logically impossible can appear. Russell claims that in order to fix this flaw, set theory has to be stricter. Sets, according to Russell, can only pertain to particular collections impossibility  and that  satisfy  specific  axioms  (thus  avoiding the contradiction that can appear from the current model). It is because of the work of Bertrand Russell that all set theory work prior to Russell is known as  naïve  set  theory,  and  all  set  theory  work  after  Russell  is  known  as axiomatic set theory.']...\n",

While he originally believed arithmetic  followed  strict  empiricism,  through  the  help  of  Gottlob  Frege, Husserl  concluded  that  certain  arithmetic  truths  cannot  be  explained through empiricism. In his book, The Logical Investigations, Husserl argued against  “psychologism,”  the  idea  that  truths  are  dependent  of  the psychology  (mind)  of  an  individual,  and  asserted  that  truths  cannot  be reduced  by  the  human  mind.  From  this  idea,  Husserl  began  to  develop phenomenology. Phenomenology, according to Husserl, is the idea that consciousness has intentionality.  This  means  that  all  acts  of  consciousness  are  directed  at objects, be they material or ideal (such as mathematics). Intentional objects of  consciousness  and  intentional  acts  of  consciousness  are  both  defined through  consciousness.  In  order  for  one  to  describe  the  object  of consciousness and content of consciousness, it is also not necessary for the object to actually exist (allowing for someone to describe what happened in a dream in the same way he could describe a scene in a book). While  Husserl’s  early  work  was  based  on  a  realist  approach  (believing that when one’s consciousness perceives an object, it means there are both objects of consciousness and the objects themselves), Husserl’s later work shifted more toward intentionality and the study of ego. Husserl’s evolving stance  and  turn  toward  transcendental  ideas  would  come  to  reinvent  the very subject he started. In  Husserl’s  1931  book,  Ideas:  A  General  Introduction  to  Pure Phenomenology,  he  makes  a  distinction  between  a  person’s  natural standpoint,  which  is  the  ordinary  viewpoint  where  an  individual  is  only aware  of  those  things  factually  present,  and  a  person’s  phenomenological standpoint, where an individual sees past the external object and comes to understand the  consciousness  of the  object.  In  order to  attain  a phenomenological  standpoint,  one  must  eliminate  various  features  of  his experience by undergoing a series of phenomenological reductions. Husserl created many phenomenological reductions; however, two of the most  noteworthy  phenomenological  reductions  include  epoché  and  the reduction proper.']...\n",

The  epoché,  however,  is  the phenomenological  reduction  where  one  no  longer  accepts  these  aspects  to be true. An individual must attain a self-consciousness by seeing himself as no  longer  a  part  of  the  things  that  he  has  come  to  accept  in  the  world. Husserl  refers  to  this  process  as  “bracketing.”  Bracketing  does  not  mean denying  the  world’s  existence—the  entire  purpose  of  bracketing  and  the epoché is to abstain from all belief, and therefore one can neither confirm nor deny the world’s existence.']...\n",

The  next  step  is  known  as  eidetic  reduction.  It  is  simply  not  enough  to have  consciousness.  Rather,  one  has  to  make  the  various  acts  of consciousness  obtainable to  a point that their  very essences,  the  structures that  cannot  be  changed  and  are  universal,  can  be  attained.  A  type  of intuition  that  one  can  use  to  do  this  is  known  as  “Wesensschau.”  In Wesensschau,  one  has  to  create  multiple  variations  and  focus  in  on  what part of the multiplicity remains unchanged. This is the essence, for it is the one identical part throughout all of the variations. The  third  and  final  step  is  known  as  transcendental  reduction.  For Husserl, phenomenology meant returning one to his transcendental ego (the self  that  is  required  for  there  to  be  a  complete,  united,  and  empirical  self- consciousness) as the foundation for creating meaning. Husserl claimed that in  order  to  reach  the  transcendental  ego,  there  must  be  a  reversal  of  the transcendental  consciousness,  and  that  within  this  consciousness  is  the creation of time awareness that acts as a self-constitution. While  Husserl  would  spend  the  rest  of  his  career  attempting  to  clarify transcendental reduction, the very idea of transcendental reduction sparked controversy.  As  a  result,  a  division  occurred  within  phenomenology between  those  who  believed  in  transcendental  reduction  and  those  who refused to believe in transcendental reduction.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Entities  within  nominalism  about  propositions  can  be  broken  into  two categories:  unstructured  and  structured.  Unstructured  propositions  are  sets of  possible  worlds.  Within  these  worlds,  functions  have  the  value  of  True (arguing  the  proposition  is  true)  and  the  value  of  False  (arguing  the proposition is false). One  theory  of  nominalism  about  propositions  claims  that  the  roles connected with propositions are in fact played by objects that are concrete. A theory pertaining to this idea is the notion that sentences take on the role of  propositions.  Philosopher  Willard  van  Orman  Quine  claimed  that “eternal sentences” (sentences with a constant truth-value throughout) make for better truth-bearers because they are independent of place, time, speaker, etc. This, however, leads to a problem for nominalists because the very idea of an eternal sentence is an abstract object. Semantic Fictionalism Another option in nominalism about propositions is to deny the existence of propositions and all entities that have theoretical roles. If this is the case, sentences  that  involve  the  existence  of  propositions  that  seem  to  be  true must  actually  be  false.  Even  if  a  sentence  is  false  because  there  are  no propositions,  however,  it  can  still  be  used  as  a  descriptive  aid.  This descriptive aid allows one to clarify what he wants to say and allows for the representation of parts of the world’s structure.']...\n",

A  nominalist  can  assume  that  there  are  no possible worlds or that possible worlds are not abstract objects. One  nominalist  approach  is  to  believe  that  not  every  possible  world exists,  and  that  only  actual  possible  worlds  exist.  One  can  think  of  actual possible worlds as being sums of spatiotemporal objects that are related to one another, which is actually the sum of concrete objects. Another  nominalist  way  to  look  at  possible  worlds  is  to  view  what  is possible  as  a  combination  of  elements  (universals  and  particulars). According to this theory, a state of affairs that has a universal as a property consists  of  a  particular  and  a  universal  coming  together,  and  a  state  of affairs that consists of a universal as a relation is when a universal and some particulars  come  together.  There  is  a  wide  range  of  possible  combinations for  particulars  and  universals,  and  the  result  is  that  some  are  actualized while others are not.']...\n",

In  addition  to  his  work  in rationalism,  Leibniz  was  quite  versatile  and  made  great  strides  in  subjects like logic, physics, and mathematics (he invented calculus independently of Newton and discovered the binary system). Leibniz was born on July 1, 1646, in Leipzig, Germany. Leibniz’s father was a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Leipzig, and when Gottfried was just six years old, his father died and left his personal library to the young Leibniz. In his father’s absence, Leibniz learned religion and morality from his mother. Leibniz was an incredibly gifted child. By the time he was twelve years old,  he  had  already  taught  himself  Latin  and  started  learning  Greek,  and when  he  was  fourteen  years  old,  he  began  attending  the  University  of Leipzig  and  took  classes  in  Aristotelian  philosophy,  law,  logic,  and scholastic philosophy. When he was twenty years old, he published his first book, On the Art of Combinations, in which he claimed that combinations of  basic  elements,  such  as  sound,  colors,  letters,  and  numbers,  are  the source of all discovery and reasoning. After  graduating  from  another  school  with  a  law  degree,  instead  of further  pursuing  academia,  he  worked  in  service  for  noblemen.  He  wore many  hats  in  this  position,  including  acting  as  a  legal  advisor  and  official historian, and he was required to travel extensively throughout Europe. On his  many  travels,  Leibniz  met  with  several  of  Europe’s  most  important intellectuals while at the same time working on his own mathematical and metaphysical  problems.  The  men  that  had  a  particular  influence  on  him during  these  times  were  philosopher  Baruch  Spinoza  and  mathematician, astronomer, and physicist Christiaan Huygens. All  of  Leibniz’s  work,  from  his  numerous  contributions  to  mathematics to  his  vast  and  rich  philosophical  work,  shares  a  common  theme  of emphasizing the truth. He hoped that, by emphasizing the truth through his work,  he  would  be  able  to  form  a  foundation  capable  of  reuniting  the divided church.']...\n",

Leibniz  claimed  that  only  those beings  that  are  capable  of  action  and  have  true  unity  can  be  considered  a substance. According to Leibniz, monads are the elements that make up the universe.  These  are  particles  that  are  individual,  eternal,  un-interacting, affected  by  their  own  laws,  and  have  a  pre-established  harmony  in  which the entire universe is reflected. These particles are the only true substances because they have unity and are capable of action. Monads  are  not  like  atoms.  They  have  no  spatial  character  or  material and are independent from one another. Monads “know” what to do at every moment because they are preprogrammed with individual instructions (via the law of pre-established harmony). Monads can also vary in size, unlike atoms. For example, every individual person can be viewed as an individual monad (which creates an argument against free will). Leibniz’s theory of monads gets rid of the dualism found in Descartes’s work, and leads to Leibniz’s theory of idealism. Monads are forms of being, meaning  only  they  are  considered  mind-like  entities  and  substance.  As  a result, things like matter, space, and motion are just phenomena that are the result of substances.']...\n",

Believing that God, who is all-powerful and all-knowing, would never create a world that is imperfect or choose to create a world that is  imperfect  when  the  possibility  of  having  a  better  one  exists,  Leibniz concluded  that  this  world  must  be  the  most  balanced  and  best  possible world there can be. Therefore, according to Leibniz, the flaws of this world have  to  exist  in  every  possible  world.  Otherwise,  those  flaws  would  not have been included by God. Leibniz  believed  that  philosophy  is  not  meant  to  contradict  theology because reason and faith are gifts of God. Thus, if any part of faith cannot be  supported  by  reason,  it  has  to  be  rejected.  With  this  in  mind,  Leibniz tackled a central criticism of Christianity: If God is all-powerful, all-wise, and  all-good,  how  did  evil  come  about?  Leibniz  states  that  God  is  all- powerful, all-wise, and all-good; however, humans are God’s creations, and as such, they  have limited wisdom  and power  to  act.  Because humans  are creations  that  have  free  will,  they  are  predisposed  to  ineffective  actions, wrong  decisions,  and  false  beliefs.

Spinoza  was  an  incredibly gifted student, and it is believed that his congregation was grooming him to become a rabbi. When he was seventeen years old, however, Spinoza had to stop his studies to help run his family’s business. On July 27, 1656, Spinoza was excommunicated from Amsterdam’s Sephardic community for reasons still  unknown  (though  it  is  believed  that  it  was  a  response  to  Spinoza’s emerging thoughts that would come to define his philosophy). The  philosophy  of  Baruch  Spinoza  was  incredibly  radical,  and  he  had very naturalistic views on morality, God, and human beings. Spinoza denied that  the  soul  is  immortal  and  rejected  the  idea  that  God  is  providential. Instead, he argued that the Law was not given by God or binding on Jews any longer. By  1661,  Spinoza  had  lost  all  faith  and  religious  commitment  and  no longer lived in Amsterdam. While living in Rijnsburg, he composed several treatises;  however,  only  his  1663  exposition  on  Descartes’s  Principles  of Philosophy  would  be  published  under  his  name  during  his  lifetime.  By 1663, Spinoza began to write his most profound philosophical text, Ethics; however,  he  stopped  writing  it  to  work  on  his  controversial  Theological- Political  Treatise,  which  was  published  anonymously  in  1670.  The controversy  surrounding  Theological-Political  Treatise  made  Spinoza abstain  from  publishing  any  more  of  his  work,  and  in  1676,  Spinoza  met with Leibniz to discuss his recently completed Ethics,  which he dared  not publish.

For  Spinoza,  “Love  thy  neighbor”  is  God’s  only  message,  and  religion has turned into superstition, with words on a page meaning more than what the words represent. To Spinoza, the Bible was not a divine creation; rather, one should look at it like they would any other historical text, and because (he  believed)  it  was  written  over  many  centuries,  its  content  is  unreliable. Miracles,  according  to  Spinoza,  do  not  exist  and  all  have  natural explanations;  however,  he  claimed,  people  choose  to  not  seek  out  such explanations. While Spinoza believed that prophesies did come from God, he claimed that they were not privileged knowledge.

Spinoza then revealed his  political  agenda  and  claimed  that  the  ideal  form  of  government  is  a democracy, because in a democracy there is the least abuse of power.']...\n",

In  Ethics,  Spinoza  further expands upon his thoughts on God and nature. Everything that exists in the universe, according to Spinoza, is a part of nature (and therefore, God), and all things in nature follow identical basic laws. Spinoza takes a naturalistic approach (which was quite radical at the time) and claims that humans can be  understood  and  explained  in  the  same  ways  as  anything  else  in  nature, for humans are no different from the natural world. Spinoza rejected the idea that God created the world out of nothing at a particular  time.  Instead,  he  claimed  that  our  system  of  reality  can  be considered  its  own  ground  and  that  there  is  no  supernatural  element,  just nature and God.']...\n",

      "Content: ['In the second part of Ethics, Spinoza focuses on the nature and origin of humans.  Spinoza  claimed  that  the  two  attributes  of  God  that  humans  are aware of having are thought and extension. Modes of thought include ideas, while  modes  of  extension  include  physical  bodies,  and  the  two  act  as separate  essences.  Bodily  events  are  the  results  of  a  causal  series  of  other bodily events and determined only by the laws that correspond to extension, while  ideas  are  only  the  result  of  other  ideas  and  follow  their  own  set  of laws.  Therefore,  there  is  not  any  type  of  causal  interaction  between  the mental  and  the  physical;  however,  they  are  correlated  and  parallel  to  one another,  so  that  with  every  mode  of  extension,  there  is  a  corresponding mode of thought. Because thought and extension are attributes of God, they are two ways in which one can understand nature and God. Unlike Descartes’s dualism, Spinoza’s  theory  does  not  claim  that  there  exist  two  separate  substances. Rather, thought and extension are two expressions of one thing: a human.']...\n",

These ideas, which are based on perceptual, sensory, and qualitative (like pain and pleasure) information, do not lead one to have true or adequate knowledge of the world because they are being perceived through the order of nature. This method of perception is a never-ending source of error and is referred to as “knowledge from random experience.” According to Spinoza, the second type of knowledge is reason. When one has  an  adequate  idea,  he  attains  it  through  a  rational  and  orderly  manner, and these ideas have a true understanding of a thing’s essence. An adequate idea  of  something  is  able  to  grasp  all  of  the  causal  connections  and  show that it is a certain way, why it is a certain way, and how it is a certain way. One can never have an adequate idea through sense experience alone. Spinoza’s notion of the adequate idea shows a great optimism in human capabilities  unlike  those  seen  before.  According  to  Spinoza,  humans  have the capability to know all there is to know of nature and, therefore, know all there is to know of God.']...\n",

      "Content: ['Spinoza went to great lengths to prove that humans are a part of nature. By showing this, Spinoza implied that humans do not have freedom, for the mind  and  ideas  are  a  result  of  a  causal  series  of  ideas  that  follow  thought (which is an attribute from God), and actions are caused by natural events. Spinoza then divides affects (emotions like anger, love, pride, envy, etc., which  also  follow  nature)  into  passions  and  actions.  When  an  event  is caused as the result of our nature (like knowledge or adequate ideas), then the mind is acting. When an event within ourselves occurs as the result of something  outside  of  our  nature,  then  we  are  being  acted  upon  and  being passive. Regardless of whether we are acting or being acted upon, a change occurs  within  our  mental  or  physical  capacities.  Spinoza  claimed  that  all beings  have  an  essence  of  striving  to  persevere,  and  that  an  affect  is  a change in this power. According  to  Spinoza,  humans  should  strive  to  free  themselves  of passions  and  become  active.  However,  since  being  free  of  passions  is  not entirely  possible,  humans  must  try  to  restrain  and  moderate  them.  In becoming  active  and  restraining  passions,  humans  become  “free”  in  the sense that whatever occurs will be the result of one’s own nature, and not from external forces. This process will also free humans from the ups and downs of life. For Spinoza, humans need to free themselves from relying on imagination  and  the  senses.  Passions  show  how  external  things  can  affect our powers.']...\n",

In  the  end,  this  means striving for knowledge of God (the third type of knowledge). Knowledge of God creates a love for objects that is not a passion, but blessedness.

In  the  twentieth  century,  philosophers  began  to  challenge  the standard  religious  language  and  attempted  to  reject  any  claims  that  were nonempirical, claiming them to be meaningless. This school of thought was known as logical positivism. According  to  logical  positivists,  only  those  claims  that  contained empirical inferences or were from mathematics and logic could be deemed meaningful.  This  meant  that  many  religious  statements,  even  those  that pertained  to  God  (like  “Yahweh  is  a  compassionate  and  gracious  God”), could not be verified and were therefore deemed meaningless. In the second half of the twentieth century, as many philosophers began to  find  the  claims of logical positivism to  be problematic and the  work  in language  by  Ludwig  Wittgenstein  and  the  work  in  naturalism  by  Willard van  Orman  Quine  became  increasingly  more  popular,  logical  positivism began  to  wane.  By  the  1970s,  the  school  of  thought  had  practically collapsed, opening the door for new theories and interpretations of religious language. After logical positivism, there were two schools of thought pertaining to religious language: realism and antirealism. Those who believed in realism believed  that  the  language  corresponds  to  what  actually  happened,  while those  who  believed  in  antirealism  believed  that  the  language  does  not correspond  to  reality  (rather,  religious  language  refers  to  human  behavior and experience).']...\n",

If God is able to get rid of evil but does not want to, then God is malevolent. 3. If God does not wish to get rid of evil and is not able to get rid of evil, then God is malevolent and feeble, and therefore, he is not God. 4. If God wants to get rid of evil and is able to get rid of evil, then why does evil exist in the world, and why has God not gotten rid of it? St. Thomas Aquinas responded to the logical problem of evil by stating that it is not clear whether or not the absence of evil would make the world a  better  place,  for  without  evil,  there  would  be  no  meaning  to  kindness, justice,  fairness,  or  self-sacrifice.  Another  argument  against  the  logical problem of evil, known as the “unknown purpose defense,” states that since God  can  never  be  truly  known,  humans  have  limitations  when  trying  to guess God’s motivations.']...\n",

      "Font Height: 15, Text: The four main theories are:, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: 1. No False Belief Condition: This theory states a belief cannot be based, Bold: True\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: on a belief that is false. For example, a watch stops working at 10 a.m.,, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: and you are unaware of this fact. Twelve hours later, at 10 p.m., you, Bold: False\n",

      "Font Height: 15, Text: 2. Causal Connection Condition: Between knowledge and a belief, there, Bold: True\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: has to be a causal connection. For example, consider the following, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: situation. Tom believes Frank is in his bedroom. Tom sees Frank, Bold: False\n",

      "Font Height: 15, Text: Sam and knowing Frank is in the room., Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: 3. Conclusive Reasons Condition: A reason for a belief must exist that, Bold: True\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: would not exist if the belief itself were false. For example, if a person, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: believes there is a table in front of him, the reason would not exist if, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: there was not a table in front of him., Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: 4. Defeasibility Condition: This theory states that as long as there is not, Bold: True\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: evidence pointing to the contrary, a belief is known. In the scenario, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: with Tom, Frank, and Sam, Tom is entitled to say Frank is in the, Bold: False\n",

      "Font Height: 15, Text: false., Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: Therefore, hard determinism is false., Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: Premise 1 defines choice as a decision or mental event, and its rationale, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: is  simple  observation;  we  see  people  making  choices  every  day.  For, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: example, people choose what clothes to wear, what food to eat, what time to, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: wake up, etc. Premise 2 defines “acting freely” as choosing what we do. If, Bold: False\n",

      "Font Height: 15, Text: means  that  he  is  acting  freely.  Premise  3  is  the  negation  of  hard, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: determinism., Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: Because the “argument from choice” is a valid argument, it seems at first, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: to be a solid objection to hard determinism. Further analysis of its definition, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: of  acting  freely,  however,  demonstrates  the  argument  to  be  unsound., Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: Because the “argument from choice” does not deny that events are caused,, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: each assertion that it makes is subject to the laws of causality. With this in, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: mind, it becomes clear that the main problem with the argument is its leap, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: from the first premise to the second., Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: Though people do, indeed, make what appear to be choices about various, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: aspects of their lives, it does not follow that they are acting freely. A choice, Bold: False\n",
      "Font Height: 15, Text: is  a  caused  event.  Therefore,  a  person’s  choice  to  act  in  some  way  is  not,, Bold: False\n",
